## About

**Description.** Morphine, the main alkaloid of opium, was first obtained from poppy seeds in 1805.[A176035] It is a potent analgesic, though its use is limited due to tolerance, withdrawal, and the risk of abuse.[A176050] Morphine is still routinely used today, though there are a number of semi-synthetic opioids of varying strength such as [codeine], [fentanyl], [methadone], [hydrocodone], [hydromorphone], [meperidine], and [oxycodone].

Morphine was granted FDA approval in 1941.[L12114]

**Indication.** Morphine is used for the management of chronic, moderate to severe pain.[A176050]

Opiods, including morphine, are effective for the short term management of pain. Patients taking opioids long term may need to be monitored for the development of physical dependence, addiction disorder, and drug abuse.[L5728]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| popPK | Yang_2024 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study focuses on naloxone PK and uses morphine only as a comparator in PK-PD simulations, with no original quantitative morphine PK parameters reported in the text. |
