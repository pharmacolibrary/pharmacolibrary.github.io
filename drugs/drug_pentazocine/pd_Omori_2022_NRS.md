<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Pentazocine drives name (in unknown): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of name.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Pentazocine plasma concentration acts on the NRS pain score via an indirect response model in which the drug inhibits the production of pain (with an additional time-dependent effect on pain increase), fitted sequentially with a two-compartment PK model. For the original dataset, the reported estimates are EC50 = 176.3 ng/mL, kout = 3.35 /h, PT max = 0.57, PT 50 = 17.9 h, and γ time = 0.63; Emax was fixed at 1.
