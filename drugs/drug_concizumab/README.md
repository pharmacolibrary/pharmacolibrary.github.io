## About

**Description.** Concizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting the Kunitz-2 domain of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a key regulator of the coagulation cascade.[A264883,A264878] In patients with hemophilia A or B - characterized by deficiencies in clotting factors VIII or IX, respectively - the traditional treatment involves replacement of the missing clotting factor.[L52043] One disadvantage of this approach is the possible development of antibodies (inhibitors) towards the administered replacement factor, rendering them less effective and increasing the likelihood of hemorrhagic episodes.[L52043] 

By inhibiting TFPI, concizumab enhances the production of factor Xa via the extrinsic clotting pathway.[L51998,A264878] This novel mechanism of action is effective even in the presence of inhibitors towards factors VIII or IX, as it essentially skips the intrinsic pathway in which factors VIII and IX participate. Concizumab therefore provides an important treatment option for patients who have developed inhibitors to standard clotting factor replacement therapy.[L52043]

Concizumab-mtci (Alhemo) was approved by the FDA in December 2024 for use in patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors.[L51998,L52043] In July 2025, its indication was expanded to include all patients with hemophilia A or B, regardless of the presence of inhibitors.[L53653]

**Indication.** Concizumab is indicated for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients ≥12 years of age who have hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors.[L53653,L54196] In the EU, its indication in patients without inhibitors is specifically for those with severe hemophilia A or moderate/severe hemophilia B.[L54196]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| popPK | Eichler_2019 | relevant | 8 | 2 | The paper describes a compartmental PK model for concizumab but explicitly states that the detailed description and parameter values are in a separate manuscript, providing only qualitative comparisons and PD parameters (EC50) in the text. |
| popPK | Miyazawa_2025 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The paper is a mechanistic mathematical modeling study of coagulation that uses a fixed concizumab concentration (4 nM) as an input parameter, rather than reporting quantitative pharmacokinetic disposition parameters (CL, V, t1/2) for the drug. |
| PGx | Shima_2016 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a general review of therapies for hemophilia inhibitors and mentions concizumab only as a novel therapeutic concept without reporting any pharmacogenomic effects on its PK or PD parameters. |
| popPK | Yuan_2019 | relevant | 9 | 0 | The paper describes a systems PK/PD model for concizumab, but the specific numeric parameter values are not present in the provided evidence text. |
