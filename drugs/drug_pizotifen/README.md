## About

**Description.** Pizotifen belongs to the class of antamines and is related to [cyproheptadine].[A32532] It is a potent serotonin and tryptamine antagonist that has been used for migraine prevention for many years. It exhibits weak anticholinergic, antihistamine, and antikinin actions in addition to sedative and appetite-stimulating properties [L2292]. Some patients receiving pizotifen treatment developed tolerance with the prolonged use of the drug [L2292]. Numerous studies have revealed the potential antidepressant effects of pizotifen, which are independent of its antimigraine action [A32538]. While it is suggested that pizotifen may act similarly to the classic tricyclic antidepressants [A32538], its full mechanism of antidepressant action is not fully elucidated. Pizotifen hydrochloride is an active ingredient in Sandomigran, which is used for the prophylactic management of migraines. Sandomigran is available in a number of countries but is not approved by the FDA nor EMA.

**Indication.** Indicated for the prophylactic management of migraines [L2292].

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
