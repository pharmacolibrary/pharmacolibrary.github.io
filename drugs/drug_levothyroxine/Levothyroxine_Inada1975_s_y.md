A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**K12 has no unit.**

Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. Extracted — levothyroxine: V 73.1 liter, kel 0.361 per day, V3 41 liter, k12 0.0308.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which molecule was measured: this record has thyroxine and triiodothyronine, the second reading thyroxine; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `L-thyroxine`, measured `levothyroxine`.

**Parameters:** 4 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Age (yr)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Inada_1975_table_2:row1:col6'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'per day' (kel)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'MCR* (liter/day)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Inada_1975_table_2:row4:col6', 'Inada_1975_table_2:row8:col6'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'λ03 (per day)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Inada_1975_table_2:row7:col6'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'T4DR* (ug/day)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Inada_1975_table_2:row9:col6'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Age' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Inada_1975_table_4:row1:col6'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): '(CR) in vivo*' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Inada_1975_table_4:row2:col6'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ET T₄ x K₁₂/T₄DR†' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Inada_1975_table_4:row4:col6'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ET T₄ x K₁₂ x 0.84' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Inada_1975_table_4:row5:col6'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ET T₄ x K₁₂ x 0.84/T₃DR†' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Inada_1975_table_4:row6:col6'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=levothyroxine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 's. y.' subgroup of Inada_1975 (paper reports 12 populations: d. k., i. n., k. t., m. e., m. k. (1), m. k. (2), m. u., m. y. (1), m. y. (2), s. y., y. o., y. u.)
- unit re-normalised: kel 'per day' now converts (value unchanged)
- skipped review gap-fill of CL: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2, 3, 4
- transposed table Inada_1975_table_2: parameters were across the columns, populations/subgroups down the first column — transposed for parsing
- unparsed cell Inada_1975_table_2:row8:col14 = '&lt;0.05'
- unparsed cell Inada_1975_table_2:row9:col14 = '&lt;0.001'
- unparsed cell Inada_1975_table_3:row0:col6 = 'λ03'
- transposed table Inada_1975_table_4: parameters were across the columns, populations/subgroups down the first column — transposed for parsing
- unparsed cell Inada_1975_table_4:row2:col14 = '&lt;0.001'
