<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The model does not reproduce the paper's terminal half-life (model/paper ratio 0.734).**

Simulated as the paper dosed it, the model's terminal half-life differs from the value the paper reports by more than the tolerance. A reported unit could not be converted (CL, V, Vss and t1/2α), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — cabazitaxel: CL 12.1 n = 34, V 20.5 n = 34, Vss 3.27e+03 n = 34, t1/2α 4.99 n = 34, t1/2β 2.39 n = 34, t1/2γ 210 n = 34.

The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 34' (CL)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 34' (V1)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 34' (Vss)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 34' (t1/2α)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 34' (t1/2β)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 34' (t1/2γ)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=cabazitaxel
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count
- 1C volume normalization: Q63→Q61 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'V1, L/m2' is the general volume)
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'ard6191(n = 34)' subgroup of Ferron_2013 (paper reports 7 populations: all(n = 170), ard6191(n = 34), efc6193(n = 67), nonmem, ted6188(n = 21), ted6189(n = 13), ted6190(n = 35))

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell Tab4:row1:col3 = '95 % CI (lower)'
- unparsed cell Tab4:row1:col4 = '95 % CI (upper)'
- transposed table Ferron_2013_table_5: parameters were across the columns, populations/subgroups down the first column — transposed for parsing
- companion parameter table 5 transcribed (36 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 4, 5
