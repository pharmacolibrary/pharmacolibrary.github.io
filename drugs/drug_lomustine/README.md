<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PGx | Buckner_2003 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper discusses irinotecan pharmacogenomics and mentions lomustine only as a background agent, reporting no pharmacogenomic effects on lomustine PK/PD. |
| popPK | El-Yazigi_1988 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study reports pharmacokinetic parameters for BCNU and CCNU, not lomustine. |
| PGx | Le_1993 | not_relevant | 2 | 10 | The paper reports in vitro enzyme inhibition (Ki) of CYP2D6 by lomustine, but does not report a pharmacogenomic effect (genotype-dependent change) on lomustine's PK or PD parameters in humans. |
| PGx | Prakash_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes a computational framework for drug repurposing and does not report pharmacogenomic effects on the PK or PD of lomustine. |
| PGx | Radtke_2022 | not_relevant | 2 | 5 | The study reports that ABCB1 knockout did not alter the response to lomustine, indicating no pharmacogenomic effect on its PD parameters. |
| popPK | Rodón_2015 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of galunisertib, with lomustine serving only as a co-administered comparator agent for which no quantitative PK parameters are reported. |
| PD | Rodón_2015 | not_relevant | 4 | 4 | The paper reports PD for galunisertib (pSMAD2 inhibition vs concentration), but does not provide numeric PD parameters or an extractable exposure-response relationship for lomustine. |
| PGx | Villikka_1999 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports pharmacokinetic changes in vincristine due to drug-drug interactions (CYP3A4 induction), not pharmacogenomic effects on lomustine. |
| popPK | Wick_2004 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic analysis of neurotoxicity and cell death, reporting EC50 values rather than pharmacokinetic disposition parameters. |
| PGx | Zhou-Pan_1993 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates vinblastine metabolism and mentions lomustine only as a drug that inhibits vinblastine biotransformation, without reporting any pharmacogenomic effects on lomustine's PK or PD. |
