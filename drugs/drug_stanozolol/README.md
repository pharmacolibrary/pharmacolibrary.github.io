## About

Stanozolol is an anabolic steroid used to promote growth and treat conditions involving protein loss, such as hereditary angioedema. It is approved for human use and also approved for veterinary use, though it is controlled in many countries because of misuse in sports.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
