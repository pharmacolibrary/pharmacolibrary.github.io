## About

Maprotiline is an antidepressant used to treat depression, and has also been used for conditions such as anxiety, pain, and bulimia nervosa. It is an approved drug, though not authorised in the European Union, and is used relatively little today.

| PGx | Spigset_1997 | not_relevant | 2 | 0 | The study investigates the association between CYP2D6/2C19 genotypes and the incidence of seizures/myoclonus (adverse events), not the direct effect of genotype on specific pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters of maprotiline. |
| PGx | Sreter_2017 | not_relevant | 2 | 0 | The paper is a case report describing adverse drug reactions (rhabdomyolysis and Ogilvie's syndrome) and mentions retrospective pharmacogenetic testing, but it does not report specific quantitative changes in PK or PD parameters of maprotiline linked to a specific gene variant. |
| popPK | Sudoh_2003 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the local anesthetic efficacy of maprotiline in rats and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| PD | Sudoh_2003 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The paper reports qualitative efficacy (complete vs. no blockade) and compares in vitro IC50 values for a different target (Nav1.5), but does not provide a quantitative concentration-effect curve or numeric PD parameters (like Emax or EC50) for the in vivo local anesthetic effect of maprotiline. |
| popPK | Wang_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a mechanistic study on Nav1.7 channel inhibition where maprotiline is used only as a structural lead/comparator, and no pharmacokinetic parameters are reported. |
| PD | Wang_2020 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the discovery of a new compound (10o) and only mentions maprotiline as a known inhibitor in the introduction/figures without providing specific PD parameters or dose-response data for maprotiline itself. |
| popPK | Wilde_1995 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of tianeptine, and maprotiline is only mentioned as a comparator drug without any quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters provided. |
| PD | Wilde_1995 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of tianeptine and does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response data for maprotiline. |
| popPK | Zahradník_2008 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro electrophysiology investigation of calcium channel inhibition, not a pharmacokinetic study, and reports no disposition parameters for maprotiline. |
