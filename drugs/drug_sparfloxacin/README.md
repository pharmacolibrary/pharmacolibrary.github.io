## About

Sparfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that was used to treat bacterial infections such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and other respiratory, staphylococcal, and gram-negative infections. It has been withdrawn from the market because of serious safety concerns, including heart rhythm problems and severe skin reactions to sunlight.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Bischoff_2000 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro electrophysiology investigation of HERG channel inhibition and does not report pharmacokinetic disposition parameters. |
| popPK | Delon_1999 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The paper focuses on convulsant activity and relative CSF-to-plasma concentration ratios in rats, but does not provide standard population-pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, ka) or extractable numeric disposition values for sparfloxacin. |
| popPK | Kamberi_1999 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study focuses on ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics, using sparfloxacin only as a comparator in in vitro antimicrobial activity tests, with no PK parameters reported for sparfloxacin. |
| popPK | Kihira_2004 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a PK-PD simulation study for fluoroquinolones against anthrax using ciprofloxacin data in monkeys, where sparfloxacin is a secondary drug evaluated via simulation rather than a subject of original PK parameter measurement. |
| popPK | Liu_2005 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on blood-brain barrier permeability and in vitro uptake mechanisms rather than reporting systemic population pharmacokinetic parameters like clearance or volume for sparfloxacin. |
| popPK | Madaras-Kelly_2002 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | This is an in-vitro pharmacodynamic study of bacterial resistance mechanisms, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, etc.) for sparfloxacin. |
| popPK | Marchand_2001 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The study investigates a pharmacodynamic interaction (proconvulsant effect of BPAA) and reports efficacy/potency parameters (CCSF ratios, IC50), not standard quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, ka, t1/2) for sparfloxacin. |
| PGx | Pal_2006 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper discusses sparfloxacin as an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein in the context of drug-drug interactions, not as a substrate whose PK is modified by a pharmacogenomic variant. |
| popPK | Ross_2001 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The study is an in vitro pharmacodynamic investigation focusing on bacterial resistance mechanisms (MICs) rather than reporting quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, etc.) for the host. |
