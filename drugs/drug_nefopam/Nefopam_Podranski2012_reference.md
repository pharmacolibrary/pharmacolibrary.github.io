A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The nefopam two-compartment record was rejected because the clearance parameter (52.9 litre h⁻¹) carries a unit that could not be converted to SI, and the peripheral compartment appears unreachable from the dose.**

For nefopam in healthy adults, the elimination clearance is reported as 52.9 litre h 21, a unit that could not be converted to a standard (SI) expression, so no SI value could be established for this parameter. The structure check also flagged an unreachable or orphan compartment in the two-compartment topology. A second reader additionally disagreed on the extracted values, reading null for the clearance (52.9), V1 (24.3 litre) and V2 (183.3 litre), and reporting 4481 for a parameter absent from this record. Extracted — nefopam: V1 24.3 litre, V2 183 litre, CL 52.9 litre h 21.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of elimination clearance [cl el (se %)]: this record has 52.9, the second reading none; it also differs on 3 more fields. That field does not shape the model.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'variable unit' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'NPD' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row2:col1', 'tab_0:row2:col2', 'tab_0:row2:col3', 'tab_0:row2:col6', 'tab_0:row2:col7', 'tab_0:row2:col8'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'POP (B) Individual data' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row3:col1', 'tab_0:row3:col2', 'tab_0:row3:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'POP' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row4:col1', 'tab_0:row4:col2', 'tab_0:row4:col3', 'tab_0:row4:col6', 'tab_0:row6:col1', 'tab_0:row6:col2', 'tab_0:row6:col4', 'tab_0:row6:col6'])
- table mostly unlinked (3/4 table-cell rows NIL) — likely the wrong table was located, not 1 genuinely-missing ontology parameter(s); route_to_review instead of building a model from the residual linked cell(s)
- salvaged Q63 ('V 1'=24.3) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q64 ('V 2'=183.3) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q22 ('elimination clearance [Cl el (SE %)]'=52.9) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=nefopam
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell tab_0:row2:col4 = 'A V 1'
- unparsed cell tab_0:row3:col4 = 'V 2 Cl el Cl dist'
- unparsed cell tab_0:row3:col5 = 'Litre Litre min 21 0.54 (0.07) 183.3 (13.5) Litre min 21 2.84 (0.42)'
