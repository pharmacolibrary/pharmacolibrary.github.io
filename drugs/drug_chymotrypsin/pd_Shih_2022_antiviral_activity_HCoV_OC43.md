<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Pentarlandir UPPTA (measured concentrations) drives name (in μM) (inhibition; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Pentarlandir UPPTA concentrations inhibit antiviral activity against HCoV-OC43 in HCT8 cells, with EC50 ≈ 1.3 μM (CC50 ≈ 206 μM); the mechanism is direct inhibition of viral proteases (3CLpro, IC50 0.474 μM, and possibly TMPRSS2), and the concentration–inhibition data were fitted with a five-parameter logistic dose–response curve; no PD rate parameters (kin, kout, ke0) are given.
>
> <sub>in the paper's terms — summarised by glm-5.3-flash from the paper's text; not checked by a person</sub>

- **paper:** `Shih_2022`
- **model family:** `unknown`
- **driver:** `conc_no_pk`
- **tier:** descriptive
- **effect:** inhibition/unknown
