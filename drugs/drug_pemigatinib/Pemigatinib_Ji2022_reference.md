<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="pemigatinib" model-id="Pemigatinib_Ji2022_reference" status="needs_review" stale="false" population="patients with advanced malignancies" measured-compound="pemigatinib" parameterization="apparent" topology="2C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 2-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 6 extracted, plus 3 covariate effects.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, Q/F, V1/F, V2/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'ka, h−1' routed out of structural estimates ('Magnitude of Interindividual Variability (%CV)')
- table section iiv: 'CL/F, L/h' routed out of structural estimates ('Magnitude of Interindividual Variability (%CV)')
- table section iiv: 'Vc/F, L' routed out of structural estimates ('Magnitude of Interindividual Variability (%CV)')
- covariate level 'Body weight (median = 73.3 kg) on Vc/F' → Q900:body_weight_median_73.3_kg_on_vc_f = 17.9 (linear_fractional on Q27)
- dropped duplicate Q290 ('Proton pump inhibitor on Vc/F', value '23.0') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'RV, SD' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['cpdd1038-tbl-0004:row13:col1', 'cpdd1038-tbl-0004:row13:col2'])
- implicit units: 'Phosphate binder on CL' — the LLM proposed '%', whose dimension does not fit Q22; left unset
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=pemigatinib
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
