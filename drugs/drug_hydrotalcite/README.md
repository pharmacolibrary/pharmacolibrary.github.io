## About

Hydrotalcite is an antacid used to treat acid-related disorders of the digestive tract, such as excess stomach acid. It is an approved medicine, available in antacid preparations, though it does not appear to be authorised centrally in the European Union.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
