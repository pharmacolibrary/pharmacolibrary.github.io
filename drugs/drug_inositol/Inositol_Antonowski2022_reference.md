<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

> **Species: rat.** This record comes from an animal study (rat), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from the LLM relevance screen, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> ℹ️ No reviewer record yet — status shown is the scholar **validate** result; simulation-based reviewer checks have not been run.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="inositol" model-id="Inositol_Antonowski2022_reference" status="rejected" stale="false" population="Wistar rats" measured-compound="myo-inositol" parameterization="apparent" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 7 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section residual_error: 'σ2 (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability')
- column 'description' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'C0 [mg/L]' → Q86 (unit '[mass] / [length] ** 3' vs ontology '[mass] * [time] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped PD-category row 'kin [1/h]' → Q327 (kin, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['ijms-23-11246-t001:row10:col1', 'ijms-23-11246-t001:row10:col2'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=myo-inositol
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 1
