## About

**Description.** Bexagliflozin is a highly specific and potent sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor.[A256408,A256413,L44758] Similar to other SGLT2 inhibitors, bexagliflozin contains three basic moieties: glucose, two benzene rings and a methylene bridge.[A256413] SGLT2 is responsible for 60% to 90% of renal glucose re-uptake, and unlike other isoforms such as SGLT1, SGLT2 is mainly expressed in the kidney.[A256408] By inhibiting SGLT2, bexagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and increases urinary glucose excretion, which reduces blood glucose levels independently of insulin sensitivity.[A256423,L44758] In January 2023, bexagliflozin was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Its use is not recommended in patients with type 1 diabetes since it may increase their risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.[L44758]

**Indication.** Bexagliflozin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L44758]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
