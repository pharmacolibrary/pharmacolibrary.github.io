## About

Phenazone (antipyrine) is a pyrazolone painkiller and fever reducer used for pain and ear conditions such as middle ear inflammation. It remains an approved medicine, used mainly in ear drops for ear pain, though it is no longer a common general painkiller.

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.
