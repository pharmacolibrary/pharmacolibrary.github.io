<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

> **Species: rat.** This record comes from an animal study (rat), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from the LLM relevance screen, p(non-human) 1.00).

## Biomarker turnover model

This page models **nitric oxide** as an endogenous turnover response, separately from the drug's pharmacokinetics.

- **driver tier:** `none`
- **turnover quantities linked:** none
- **effect blocks:** 0
- **turnover review:** <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span>
  - `B4_steady_state` — skipped: production and loss/clearance parameters are incomplete
  - `B4_effect_link` — skipped: no per-perturbing-drug effect block is linked
  - `B4_driver_link` — skipped: no driver PK source is available
