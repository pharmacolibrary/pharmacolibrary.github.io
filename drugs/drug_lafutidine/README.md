The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PGx | Hagiwara_2007 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper compares clinical outcomes of lafutidine vs lansoprazole and mentions CYP2C19 polymorphisms only to state that lafutidine's activity is unaffected, without reporting any pharmacogenomic data or PK/PD parameters. |
| popPK | Ikawa_2006 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study focuses on the correlation between lafutidine AUC and peptide release, and while it mentions a one-compartmental PK analysis, no specific quantitative PK parameters (CL, V, ka, t1/2) are reported in the evidence. |
| PGx | Isomoto_2003 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study reports that CYP2C19 genotype had no significant influence on the clinical outcome (H. pylori eradication rate), but it does not report specific pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters (e.g., AUC, Cmax, pH levels) or quantitative effect sizes for the drug. |
| PGx | Shimatani_2003 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports that lafutidine's pharmacodynamic effect (acid suppression) was not influenced by CYP2C19 genotype, meaning no pharmacogenomic effect was observed for the drug in question. |
