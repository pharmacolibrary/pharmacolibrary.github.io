<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The glycopyrronium model was quarantined because clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, absorption lag time and the intercompartmental rate constants had no source values, so library placeholders were substituted.**

For glycopyrronium in healthy volunteers, the record's clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, absorption lag time, central→peripheral rate constant and peripheral→central rate constant had no value extracted from the source, so a library placeholder stood in for each and the model was held back rather than published with invented numbers. The absorption check also failed: the absorption rate constant was defaulted because it was not reported in the source, judged 'invented absorption: not acceptable'. A second reader further disagreed on several absorption half-life entries, reading the fast lung absorption half-life as a different parameter and leaving the intermediate lung absorption half-life (0.45) and the fraction of dose with slow absorption (6.48) unconfirmed against this record. Extracted — glycopyrronium: CL 44.9, V1 11.3, Q 8.23, V2 71.5, Fab 1.11, kabs 0.009, Vss 102, t1/2z 0.45.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[fast lung absorption half-life].parameter_id`: this record has Q59, the second reading Q95; it also differs on 3 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Parameter related to fraction of dose with slow absorption' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Bartels_2013_table_p6_1:row7:col3', 'Bartels_2013_table_p6_1:row7:col4'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Parameter related to fraction of dose with intermediate absorption' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Bartels_2013_table_p6_1:row8:col3', 'Bartels_2013_table_p6_1:row8:col4'])
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('Intermediate lung absorption rate', value '1.54') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('GI tract absorption rate', value '0.34') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('Slow lung absorption half-life', value None) — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): '0' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Bartels_2013_table_2:row21:col1'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=glycopyrronium
- population split: 'population mean (%cv)' subgroup of Bartels_2013 (paper reports 3 populations: model-based, noncompartmental, population mean (%cv))
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
