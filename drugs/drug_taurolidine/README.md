## About

**Description.** Taurolidine is an antimicrobial used for the prevention of catheter-related infections. It is a derivative of the amino acid [taurine].

It was first synthesized in the 1970s and was originally used as a prophylactic against intraperitoneal bacterial infections in patients with peritonitis.[A263217] In November 2023, a catheter lock solution of taurolidine in combination with [heparin] - marketed as Defencath - received FDA approval under the Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs (LPAD pathway) for the prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections in a limited and specific patient population.[L50092]

**Indication.** Taurolidine is indicated in combination with [heparin] to reduce the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) in adult patients with kidney failure receiving chronic hemodialysis (HD) through a central venous catheter (CVC).[L49081]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
