<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**Every check that could be run on this record passed.**

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[cl/f].covariate_forms`: this record has none, the second reading ['linear_fractional']; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Weight, kg, on CL/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp412521-tbl-0002:row6:col1', 'psp412521-tbl-0002:row6:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Age, years, on CL/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp412521-tbl-0002:row7:col1', 'psp412521-tbl-0002:row7:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Albumin, g/L, on CL/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp412521-tbl-0002:row8:col1', 'psp412521-tbl-0002:row8:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Weight, kg, on V1/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp412521-tbl-0002:row9:col1', 'psp412521-tbl-0002:row9:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Albumin, g/L, on V1/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp412521-tbl-0002:row10:col1', 'psp412521-tbl-0002:row10:col2'])
- routed 'Interindividual variability of CL/F' → Q312 (IIV) to iiv — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- routed 'Interindividual variability of V1/F' → Q312 (IIV) to iiv — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=luspatercept
- 1C volume normalization: Q290→Q76 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'V1/F, L' is the general volume)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
