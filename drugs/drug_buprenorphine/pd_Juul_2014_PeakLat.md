## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Buprenorphine (concentrations from the PK model of Nelson_2024) drives PeakLat (in unknown): direct log-linear effect.

**Model:** A model was generated (see the **Models** tab); it has no in-browser simulator.

> Buprenorphine plasma concentrations act directly (no effect compartment; indirect models did not converge) on the ERP N2 peak latency (PeakLat) via a log-linear drug effect with slope h2 = 0.000349 on a baseline E0 of 138 (with a discrete covariate group factor of 0.634 distinguishing early vs late N2 subjects); no Emax, IC50, kin/kout or ke0 values are reported for this endpoint.

Closed-form check points (response, SI): `at_1` = 18.2, `per_e_fold` = 98.1

## Review

Verdict <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span>

| `T1b_fmu` | skipped | template FMU / fmpy not available — advisory only |
| `T2_direction` | skipped | a line has no plateau to compare |
