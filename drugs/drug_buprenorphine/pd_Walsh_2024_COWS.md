<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Buprenorphine (concentrations from the PK model of Nelson_2024) drives Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score (in score): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

> Buprenorphine plasma concentration (ng/mL) directly inhibits the COWS score via a sigmoid Imax model (VAS(Cp) = BASE·(1 − Imax·Cp^γ/(IC50^γ + Cp^γ))), with baseline 45.3, Imax fixed to 1.00, IC50 0.075 ng/mL, and IC90 0.109 ng/mL; the paper does not state a γ value for COWS.

> <sub>in the paper's terms — summarised by glm-5.3-flash from the paper's text; not checked by a person</sub>

- **paper:** `Walsh_2024`
- **model family:** `sigmoid_emax`
- **driver:** `cited_pk`

## Exposure-response model

`Buprenorphine_Walsh2024_PD_cows` — sigmoid_emax, `response = E0 + Emax*frac`

| parameter | value (paper units) | SI |
|---|---|---|
| E0 | 45.3 score | — |
| Emax | -1 score | — |
| EC50 | 0.075 ng/mL | 7.5e-08 kg/m3 |
| gamma | 1 | — |

Closed-form check points (response, SI): `at_0` = 45.3, `at_EC50` = 44.8, `at_inf` = 44.3

Deviations:

- `defaulted_parameters` — gamma
- `pd_binding_imax_as_negative_emax` — Imax (Q323) enters SigmoidEmaxSweep as −Emax

## Review

Verdict <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span>

| check | status | note |
|---|---|---|
| `T0_driver` | pass | driver is the drug, a synonym or one of its metabolites (or unnamed) |
| `T1_closed_form` | pass | engineer's check points reproduced from the bound parameters |
| `T1b_fmu` | skipped | template FMU / fmpy not available — advisory only |
| `T2_direction` | pass | curve direction matches effect_direction |
| `T3_plausibility` | pass | EC50, gamma, Imax and baseline in range |
| `T4_defaults` | advisory | only convention defaults (gamma = 1) |

Advisory:

- defaulted: gamma (convention)
