**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The buprenorphine record was rejected because the parameter labelled 'SLP TF (day -1)' was extracted as an elimination rate constant kel with the negative value -0.0203 day⁻¹, a dimension mismatch on a structural parameter.**

A negative elimination rate constant is pharmacokinetically impossible, and the verbatim label 'SLP TF' with unit day⁻¹ indicates a slope-type parameter rather than a terminal elimination rate, so the meaning assigned to kel does not match the reported quantity. The record also carries a Km of 0.00398 days, an enzyme-affinity parameter reported in units of time, and one reported unit could not be converted to SI, so a parameter was carried without a usable SI value. A second reader additionally read the base parameter as 0.00377 where this record has none, and left the NAS absorption parameter (0.182 hr⁻¹ here) unread. Extracted — buprenorphine: kabs 0.429 hr À1, t1/2ka 0.182 hr À1, CL 112 L/hr, V2 113 L, Q 283 L/hr, V3 1.49e+03 L, Km 0.00398 days, Emax 0.135, … (+1).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of base: this record has none, the second reading 0.00377; it also differs on 1 more field. That field does not shape the model.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Ka_ NAS (hr À1 )' → Q95 (unit '1 / [time]' vs ontology '[time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'KM (days)' → Q1 (unit '[time]' vs ontology '[mass] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'BASE' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row18:col1', 'tab_1:row18:col2', 'tab_1:row18:col3', 'tab_1:row18:col4'])
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'KM V3 (days)' → Q77 (unit '[time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q77 ('KM V3 (days)', value '0.519') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=buprenorphine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
