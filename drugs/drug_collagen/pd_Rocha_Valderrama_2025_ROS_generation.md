<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** 6-nitrocoumarin-3-thiosemicarbazone derivatives (compounds 1-8) (measured concentrations) drives name (in fluorescence) (inhibition; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> The paper does not describe a pharmacodynamic model linking 6-nitrocoumarin-3-thiosemicarbazone derivative concentrations to ROS generation (fluorescence); no mechanism, Imax/IC50 for ROS, kin/kout, ke0, or gamma values are given for that response. The reported potency values concern antiparasitic activity and cytotoxicity instead, e.g. compound 7 IC50 against T. cruzi of 22.4 µM (CC50 128.6 µM in EA.hy926 cells, 277.9 µM in BeWo cells) and compound 1 IC50 against T. gondii of 17.3 µM (CC50 386.9 µM in BeWo cells), with ROS generation only discussed qualitatively as a proposed redox-mediated contributor to antiparasitic activity.

<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label (paper)</code></td><td>the row or statistic label exactly as printed in the paper (label_verbatim) — never normalised, so it can be found in the PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Q-code · name</code></td><td>the ontology parameter this label was matched to (Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F, Q49 = ka, Q57 = half-life, …) and its canonical name. The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>second reader</code></td><td>a model that re-read the paper independently, always from a different family than the first reading (scholarv2.secondary_for): a qwen primary is checked by gpt-oss:120b, a gpt-oss primary by qwen3.8:27b-mtp-q8_0 — two checkpoints of one family share their misreads, so agreement between them would mean little. A record can have several readers.</td></tr><tr><td><code>agreement</code></td><td>share of the compared fields that reader agreed on.</td></tr><tr><td><code>verdict</code></td><td>per reader: `confirmed` it agrees throughout · `partly confirmed` a non-structural field differs · `not confirmed` a structural one differs (clearance, a volume, ka, a lag) · `primary re-run` the first reading extracted nothing and was given one hinted retry.</td></tr><tr><td><code>combined</code></td><td>the record's verdict over ALL its readers: confirmed only when every reader that answered agrees, disputed as soon as one disagrees on a structural parameter. The most favourable reading is never taken — an extra reader must not be a way to find one that agrees.</td></tr><tr><td><code>kept</code></td><td>which reading the record holds. ALWAYS the first — a disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction, so the numbers on this page are the first model's either way.</td></tr></tbody></table>
