## About

**Description.** Melphalan flufenamide, also known as melflufen or J1, is a prodrug of [melphalan].[A230123,L32173] Melphalan flufenamide is more readily uptaken by cells than melphalan, and is cleaved to the active metabolite by aminopeptidases.[A230123] _In vitro_ models show that melphalan is 10 to hundreds of times more potent than melphalan.[A230123] The increased potency makes melphalan flufenamide a treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have attempted at least 4 lines of therapy already.[A230143,L32173]

Melphalan flufenamide was granted FDA approval on 26 February 2021.[L32173]. It has since been withdrawn from the market in the wake of the phase 3 OCEAN trial which showed a decrease in overall survival in comparison to standard treatment with [pomalidomide] and [dexamethasone] despite superior progression-free survival.[L39085, L39090]

**Indication.** Melphalan flufenamide is indicated in combination with [dexamethasone] to treat adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received ≥4 therapies and are refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory agent, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.[L32173] The FDA has withdrawn the drug from the market for this indication following phase 3 trial data showing decreased overall survival.[L39090]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
