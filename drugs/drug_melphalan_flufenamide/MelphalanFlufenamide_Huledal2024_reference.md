<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**No model parameters were extracted from this paper.**

Nothing in the extracted data describes the drug's disposition, so there is no model to build.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-09-15 04:50:36.103504+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 16:15:08.302505+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `melphalan_flufenamide`, measured `melphalan`.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="melphalan flufenamide" model-id="MelphalanFlufenamide_Huledal2024_reference" status="rejected" stale="true" population="adults with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma" measured-compound="melphalan" parameterization="apparent" topology="general_linear"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** general linear; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 4 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CLm/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

### Unresolved rows _(no Q-code or no value — not parameters)_
| label (paper) | Q-code | value | link |
|---|---|---|---|
| Desethyl-melflufen exposure | Q88 | not captured | llm_confirmed |

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Desethyl-melflufen exposure' → Q88 (unit 'dimensionless' vs ontology '[mass] * [time] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- metabolite melphalan: Q22→Q351 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=melphalan
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- template fit: none — noncompartmental model — not a compartmental parent–metabolite model
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles (LLM): model_class=noncompartmental; 5/5 row label(s) assigned, 2 linked by role; re-tagged melphalan→parent ×6, melphalan→desethyl-melflufen ×1
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Huledal_2024_metadata.yaml (7 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
