> **Species: mouse.** This record comes from an animal study (mouse), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The rifaximin record was rejected because the terminal half-life is dimensionally inconsistent: t1/2β is 0.11 while t1/2z is 5.98 h for the same two-compartment disposition, a structural-parameter mismatch.**

For rifaximin in mice with S. aureus-induced mastitis, the record carries two terminal half-life values, t1/2β = 0.11 and t1/2z = 5.98 h, which describe the same slowest elimination phase of the two-compartment model and cannot both be right; the dimension check on this structural parameter failed. In addition, the AUCt unit h·μg/g could not be converted to SI, so the parameter reached the model without an SI value. The other parameters (V1 2.15, V2 0.46, CL 0.29, Q 0.89, λ1 2.38, MRT 6.66 h, Cmax 25.82 μg/g) were extracted as reported. Extracted — rifaximin: V1 2.15, V2 0.46, CL 0.29, Q 0.89, λ1 2.38, t1/2β 0.11, t1/2z 5.98 h, MRT 6.66 h, … (+2).

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'units' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'AUC24 (h·μg/g)' → Q19 (unit '[time]' vs ontology '[mass] * [time] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Cmax (μg/g)' → Q32 (unit 'dimensionless' vs ontology '[mass] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- implicit units: 'V1' → L (from the popPK convention: 'V1 is a volume of distribution. In population PK studies, volumes are conventionally expressed in liters (L). The value ')
- implicit units: 'V2' → L (from the popPK convention: 'V2 is a volume of distribution. In population PK studies, volumes are conventionally expressed in liters (L). The value ')
- implicit units: 'Cl1' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'Cl1 is a clearance parameter. In population PK studies, clearances are conventionally expressed in liters per hour (L/h)')
- implicit units: 'Cl2' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'Cl2 is an intercompartmental clearance. In population PK studies, intercompartmental clearances are conventionally expre')
- implicit units: 'α' — the LLM proposed '1/h', whose dimension does not fit Q67; left unset
- implicit units: 'ß' → h (from the popPK convention: "ß is described in the prompt as 't1/2β: Terminal half-life'. Half-lives are conventionally expressed in hours (h). The v")
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=rifaximin
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted

**Extraction notes:**
- companion parameter table 3 transcribed (18 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 3, 4
