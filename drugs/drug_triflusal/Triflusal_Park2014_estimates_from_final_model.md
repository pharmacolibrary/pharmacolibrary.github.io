<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The triflusal parent–metabolite model was quarantined because triflusal's F, CL, Vd, ka and Tlag had no reported values and library defaults were substituted, and the one-compartment structure did not match the recorded three-compartment disposition.**

No value for triflusal's bioavailability, clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time. The model was built, but triflusal's bioavailability, clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. The recorded structure — a one-compartment enteral model with metabolism of triflusal to HTB (kfm 0.341 weight/71.65) — did not match the three-compartment disposition the record describes, and the invented absorption (defaulted ka, not reported in the source) was judged not acceptable. Additionally, the reported unit weight/71.65 could not be converted to SI, so parameters such as Q2 (8.300) and kfm reached the model builder without SI values. Extracted — triflusal: Q2 8.3 weight/71.65, kfm 0.341 weight/71.65.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `model_quarantined`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θ 1' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab2:row5:col2', 'Tab2:row5:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θ 4' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab2:row6:col2', 'Tab2:row6:col3'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'weight/71.65' (Q2)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'weight/71.65' (kfm)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θ 5' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab2:row11:col2', 'Tab2:row11:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θ 6' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab2:row12:col2', 'Tab2:row12:col3'])
- routed 'ω 1 2' → Q314 (omega_cov) to covariance — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- routed 'ω 3 2' → Q314 (omega_cov) to covariance — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- routed 'ω 4 2' → Q314 (omega_cov) to covariance — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- routed 'ω 5 2' → Q314 (omega_cov) to covariance — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=HTB
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- bound model equation to Q27 (CL/F): CL/F = θ 1 * (weight/71.65)^θ4
- Q27 (CL/F) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'CL/F'; equation kept verbatim
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'estimates from final model' subgroup of Park_2014 (paper reports 3 populations: description (units), estimates from final model, shrinkage (%))
