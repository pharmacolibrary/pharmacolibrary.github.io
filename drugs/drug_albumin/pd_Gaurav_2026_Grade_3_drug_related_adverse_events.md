<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Favezelimab (measured concentrations) drives name (in AE) (stimulation; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> The paper does not describe a pharmacodynamic model linking favezelimab concentrations to Grade ≥ 3 drug-related adverse events; the reported parameters (e.g., Vc 3.08 L, Vmax 13.6 μg/h, Km 49.5 μg/L, CL 0.0195 L/h) pertain to the pharmacokinetics of favezelimab, not to an exposure–response model for the adverse-event endpoint.

- **paper:** `Gaurav_2026`
- **model family:** `unknown`
- **driver:** `conc_no_pk`
