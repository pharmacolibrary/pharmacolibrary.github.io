<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Total testosterone (measured concentrations) drives luteinizing hormone (in IU/L): indirect response — drug inhibits the loss of luteinizing hormone.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Total testosterone concentrations (ng/mL) inhibit LH30 synthesis via an indirect response model with an effect compartment: dLH30/dt = Kin(1−INH) − Kout·LH30, where INH = Ce^λ/(Ce^λ+TC50^λ) is a sigmoid Emax function (Emax fixed to 1) on the effect-compartment testosterone concentration Ce. Final estimates: TC50 = 9.33 ng/mL, λ = 18.3, Kin = 1.7 IU/day, Kout = 0.11 L/day, ke0 = 0.0321 mL/day; body weight was a covariate on TC50 (θ = −1.14 ng/mL) and thyroxin on Kin (θ = 1.19).
