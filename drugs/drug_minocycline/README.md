## About

**Description.** Minocycline was first described in the literacture in 1966.[A190681] It is a second generation tetracycline antibiotic that is active against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.[A190723] Like other semisynthetic tetracyclines, minocycline has modifications to carbons 7-9 on the D ring to generate higher efficacy than previous tetracyclines.[A190723]

Minocycline was granted FDA approval on 30 June 1971.[L11695]

**Indication.** Oral and topical minocycline are indicated to treat inflammatory lesions of acne vulgaris.[L11701,L11704,L11719] Subgingival microspheres are indicated as an adjunct treatment in the reduction of pocket depth in adults with periodontitis.[L11716] Oral and intravenous formulations are indicated to treat infections of susceptible microorganisms.[L11707,L11710,L11713] These include rickettsiae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila psittaci, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Borrelia recurrentis, Haemophilus ducreyi, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter fetus, Brucella species, Bartonella bacilliformis, Klebsiella granulomatis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Shigella species, Acinetobacter species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella species.[L11710] Additionally, oral minocycline is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) of rosacea in adults.[L52395]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
