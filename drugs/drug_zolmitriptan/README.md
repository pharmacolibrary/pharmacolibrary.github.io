## About

**Description.** Zolmitriptan is a member of the triptan class of 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT)<sub>1B/1D/(1F)</sub> receptor agonists used to treat acute migraine.[A462, L12978] [Sumatriptan] was the first triptan to be developed, but had poor oral bioavailability and lipophilicity. This led to the development of second-generation triptans, including [almotriptan], [eletriptan], [frovatriptan], [naratriptan], [rizatriptan], and zolmitriptan.[A193791] Triptans can be administered alone or in combination with an NSAID like [naproxen], and represent the current "gold standard" for acute migraine treatment.[A193797]

Zolmitriptan was first approved by the FDA for sale by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals under the trade name Zomig® on November 25, 1997. It is currently available in both tablet and nasal spray forms.[L12978]

**Indication.** Zolmitriptan is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without auras in patients aged 18 and over.[L12978]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
