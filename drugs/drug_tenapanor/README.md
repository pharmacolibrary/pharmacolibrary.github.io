## About

**Description.** Tenapanor is a novel, small molecule medication approved in September 2019 for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel-syndrome (IBS-C).[L8558] It was first designed and synthesized in 2012.[A185492] As an inhibitor of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) transporter, it is the first and currently only medication within its class[A185489,A185492,A185495] and therefore exists as a novel alternative in the treatment of IBS-C. In October 2023, tenapanor was approved for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.[L48511]

**Indication.** Tenapanor is indicated for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) in adults.[L8558] 

It is also indicated to reduce serum phosphorus in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis as add-on therapy in patients who have an inadequate response to phosphate binders or who are intolerant of any dose of phosphate binder therapy.[L48511]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
