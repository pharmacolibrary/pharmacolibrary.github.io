## About

Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker used to treat cardiovascular conditions such as high blood pressure, angina, and certain heart rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia. It is an approved medicine and appears on the WHO list of essential medicines, so it is widely used worldwide.

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

The record's per-phenotype theta is a multiplier ON that parameter: a poor-metaboliser theta shifts this value, it does not supply one. Two values are NOT parameters — Q100 (NIL) is an association or risk finding with no parameter target, and `safety` is an adverse-reaction risk such as an HLA allele.
