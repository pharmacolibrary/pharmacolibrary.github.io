A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was generated (see the **Models** tab); it has no in-browser simulator.

### Reviewer guidance

**The record for landiolol was held back because the absorption lag time parameter was not extracted, leaving the model incomplete.**

The record was built from the abstract alone, so reported summary statistics stood in for a fitted model. The parameter coverage check failed because the absorption lag time (0.82 min) was neither emitted nor defaulted. A second reader disagreed on the dose compound and primary analyte, marking them as unknown, and failed to extract values for all five parameters. Extracted — landiolol: CL 36.6 mL/min/kg, V1 101 mL/kg, Q 16.1 mL/min/kg, V2 55.6 mL/kg, tlag 0.82 min.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has landiolol hydrochloride, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 11 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q22 (total body clearance (CL); Q63 (distribution volume of the central compartment (V1); Q30 (inter-compartmental clearance); Q64 (distribution volume of the peripheral compartment)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=landiolol hydrochloride
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Honda_2008_metadata.yaml (5 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
