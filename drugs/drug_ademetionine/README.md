## About

**Description.** Physiologic methyl radical donor involved in enzymatic transmethylation reactions and present in all living organisms. It possesses anti-inflammatory activity and has been used in treatment of chronic liver disease. (From Merck, 11th ed)

**Indication.** S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) is used as a drug in Europe for the treatment of depression, liver disorders, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis. It has also been introduced into the United States market as a dietary supplement for the support of bone and joint health, as well as mood and emotional well being.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
