<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
</details>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The model does not reproduce the paper's terminal half-life (model/paper ratio 2.41).**

Simulated as the paper dosed it, the model's terminal half-life differs from the value the paper reports by more than the tolerance. Extracted — bisoprolol: CL/F 2.54 l/h, V 214 l, CL 0.0341 ml/min, IIV 0.0803.

Independently confirmed by `gpt-oss:120b`.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="bisoprolol" model-id="Bisoprolol_Nikolic2018_reference" status="needs_review" stale="false" population="patients with stable coronary artery disease" measured-compound="bisoprolol" parameterization="apparent" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment, oral mammillary model — template `PK_1C_enteral`.  
**Parameters:** 4 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['ka', 'Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)
- `invented_absorption`: ka defaulted — not reported in source
- `input_model`: first-order depot input — apparent (/F) parameterization ⇒ extravascular dosing

**Interpretation flags:**
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=bisoprolol

## Validation

**Cross-check (independent readings):** <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span>

A record can have several readers.</td></tr><tr><td><code>agreement</code></td><td>share of the compared fields that reader agreed on.</td></tr><tr><td><code>verdict</code></td><td>per reader: `confirmed` it agrees throughout · `partly confirmed` a non-structural field differs · `not confirmed` a structural one differs (clearance, a volume, ka, a lag) · `primary re-run` the first reading extracted nothing and was given one hinted retry.</td></tr><tr><td><code>combined</code></td><td>the record's verdict over ALL its readers: confirmed only when every reader that answered agrees, disputed as soon as one disagrees on a structural parameter. The most favourable reading is never taken — an extra reader must not be a way to find one that agrees.</td></tr><tr><td><code>kept</code></td><td>which reading the record holds. ALWAYS the first — a disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction, so the numbers on this page are the first model's either way.</td></tr></tbody></table>
