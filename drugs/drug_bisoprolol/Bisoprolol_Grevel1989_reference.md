<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The bisoprolol model was quarantined because bioavailability (F), clearance (Cl) and absorption lag time (Tlag) had no source values and were replaced by placeholder numbers, and the intercompartmental clearance Q was not covered by the parameter check.**

The record for bisoprolol (Grevel_1989, one-compartment structure with a peripheral compartment) carries values for V1 (55.0 L), kabs (0.43 h-1), Q (43.5 L/h) and Vss (256 L), but the paper gave no values for bioavailability, clearance and absorption lag time, so generic placeholder numbers stood in for them. The parameter-coverage check expected 3 parameters emitted or defaulted and obtained only 2, reporting Q as neither emitted nor defaulted despite its value of 43.5 L/h in the record. Because essential disposition parameters (clearance, bioavailability, lag time) were placeholders rather than fitted values, the model was held back rather than published with invented numbers. Extracted — bisoprolol: V1 55 L, kabs 0.43 h-1, Q 43.5 L/h, Vss 256 L.

Independently confirmed by `gpt-oss:120b`.

A record can have several readers.</td></tr><tr><td><code>agreement</code></td><td>share of the compared fields that reader agreed on.</td></tr><tr><td><code>verdict</code></td><td>per reader: `confirmed` it agrees throughout · `partly confirmed` a non-structural field differs · `not confirmed` a structural one differs (clearance, a volume, ka, a lag) · `primary re-run` the first reading extracted nothing and was given one hinted retry.</td></tr><tr><td><code>combined</code></td><td>the record's verdict over ALL its readers: confirmed only when every reader that answered agrees, disputed as soon as one disagrees on a structural parameter. The most favourable reading is never taken — an extra reader must not be a way to find one that agrees.</td></tr><tr><td><code>kept</code></td><td>which reading the record holds. ALWAYS the first — a disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction, so the numbers on this page are the first model's either way.</td></tr></tbody></table>
