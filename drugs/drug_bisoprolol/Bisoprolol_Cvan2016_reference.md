**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**Accepted with a caveat: the covariate scenarios were not simulated.**

The base model was simulated, not the covariate effects the record defines. A reported unit could not be converted (add_error), so that value has no SI equivalent.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of proportional: this record has none, the second reading 4.81. That field does not shape the model.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['F', 'Tlag']

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('Effect of MDRD4 on CL a', value '12.8') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q61 ('Effect of SMI on V b', value '27.1') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('CL-V correlation', value '63.8') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Proportional (%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row21:col1'])
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'CL' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['tab_0:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'V' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['tab_0:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=bisoprolol
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
