## About

**Description.** Odevixibat, or A4250, is an ileal sodium/bile acid cotransporter inhibitor indicated for the treatment of pruritus in patients older than 3 months, with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC).[A236808,L34793] Odevixibat is the first approved non-surgical treatment option for PFIC.[L34803] Previous therapies for PFIC included a bile acid sequestrant such as [ursodeoxycholic acid].[A236808]

Odevixibat was granted FDA and Health Canada approval on 20 July 2021 and 13 November 2023 respectively.[L34793,L49535]

**Indication.** Odevixibat is indicated for the treatment of pruritus in patients older than 3 months and 6 months with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) by the FDA and Health Canada respectively.[L46826,L49530] It is also indicated for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients 12 months of age and older with Alagille Syndrome.[L46826] Odevixibat may not be effective in patients with PFIC type 2 with ABCB11 variants since these patients lack a functional bile salt export pump.[L34793]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
