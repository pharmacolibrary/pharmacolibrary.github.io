## About

Methylphenobarbital (mephobarbital) is a barbiturate anticonvulsant used to treat epilepsy, including tonic–clonic and childhood absence seizures, and has also been used for anxiety and as a sedative. It remains an approved medicine, though it is not authorised in the European Union and is now only rarely used.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
