## About

Teniposide is an anticancer drug used to treat acute lymphocytic leukemia and other lymphoblastic leukemias, as well as small cell lung cancer. It is an approved antineoplastic agent, a podophyllotoxin derivative that acts as a topoisomerase II inhibitor, but it is not authorised in the European Union and is used only in limited settings.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
