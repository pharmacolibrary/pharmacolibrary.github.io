<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Polymyxin B (measured concentrations) drives name (in log10 CFU/mL): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

> In static concentration time-kill assays of six CRKP isolates, polymyxin B (0.5–64 mg/L), meropenem (10–120 mg/L) and fosfomycin (75–500 mg/L) concentrations drive the log10 CFU/mL bacterial load in a mechanism-based model where polymyxin B kills via a sigmoid Emax function on susceptible (I) and resistant (R) subpopulations (KC50,PMB,I 0.82–6.56 mg/L; KC50,PMB,R 38.34–96.78 mg/L; replication rate constant k21 fixed at 50 h−1) and additionally exerts mechanistic synergy by disrupting the bacterial outer membrane, i.e. reducing the meropenem and fosfomycin KC50 values (Imax,M,PMB 0.83–0.88 and Imax,F,PMB 0.81–0.99 for porin-mutant isolates, with IC50 for this synergy of 0.49–0.51 mg/L for mer

## Exposure-response model

`PolymyxinB_Mahadevan2026_PD_bacterial_load` — sigmoid_emax, `response = E0 + Emax*frac`

| parameter | value (paper units) | SI |
|---|---|---|
| E0 | 0 | — |
| Emax | -0.84 ImaxM,PMB | — |
| EC50 | 24.7 mg/L | 0.0247 kg/m3 |
| gamma | 1 | — |

Closed-form check points (response, SI): `at_0` = 0, `at_EC50` = -0.42, `at_inf` = -0.84

Deviations:

- `defaulted_parameters` — E0, gamma
- `pd_binding_imax_as_negative_emax` — Imax (Q323) enters SigmoidEmaxSweep as −Emax

## Review

Verdict <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span> · route to `scholar`

| check | status | note |
|---|---|---|
| `T0_driver` | pass | driver is the drug, a synonym or one of its metabolites (or unnamed) |
| `T1_closed_form` | pass | engineer's check points reproduced from the bound parameters |
| `T1b_fmu` | pass | shared PD_SigmoidEmaxSweep FMU reproduces the reference points (worst 0.00%) |
| `T2_direction` | pass | curve direction matches effect_direction |
| `T3_plausibility` | pass | EC50, gamma, Imax and baseline in range |
| `T4_defaults` | fail | a core parameter took a library default: E0 |

Advisory:

A record can have several readers.</td></tr><tr><td><code>agreement</code></td><td>share of the compared fields that reader agreed on.</td></tr><tr><td><code>verdict</code></td><td>per reader: `confirmed` it agrees throughout · `partly confirmed` a non-structural field differs · `not confirmed` a structural one differs (clearance, a volume, ka, a lag) · `primary re-run` the first reading extracted nothing and was given one hinted retry.</td></tr><tr><td><code>combined</code></td><td>the record's verdict over ALL its readers: confirmed only when every reader that answered agrees, disputed as soon as one disagrees on a structural parameter. The most favourable reading is never taken — an extra reader must not be a way to find one that agrees.</td></tr><tr><td><code>kept</code></td><td>which reading the record holds. ALWAYS the first — a disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction, so the numbers on this page are the first model's either way.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Each archive holds the model source, a script that simulates it against the appropriate library, and a README describing both and how to run them.</p>
<p><b>FMI is two downloads.</b> The archive holds this record's parameters and its driver; the simulator itself is <code>PD_SigmoidEmaxSweep.fmu</code>, one compiled template shared by every model of this structure. Take the FMU once, keep it beside the script (or pass <code>--fmu PATH</code>). Running it reproduces the model-specific FMU exactly.</p>

<sub>Runs this record's model in the browser as WebAssembly. Sliders start at the extracted values; the reference check compares the browser's peak against the FMPy result recorded when the record was built, and is withheld once a value has been edited. Template `PD_SigmoidEmaxSweep` · parameters `PolymyxinB_Mahadevan2026_PD_bacterial_load_params.json` · controls `PolymyxinB_Mahadevan2026_PD_bacterial_load_sim_controls.json`. A slider marked *simulator value* is running on the template's own default because this record does not pin that parameter.</sub>
