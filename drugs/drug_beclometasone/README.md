<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| popPK | Würthwein_1990 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on receptor binding affinity and metabolic hydrolysis rates (activation) rather than quantitative pharmacokinetic disposition parameters (CL, V, ka) for beclometasone. |
| popPK | Yadav_2013 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro investigation of bacterial stability/metabolism in simulated colonic fluid, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, etc.) for beclometasone. |
