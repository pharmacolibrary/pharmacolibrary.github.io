<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The record, nominally for alfentanil, carries sufentanil parameters (CL 11.3 ml/min/kg, V 0.39 L/kg, V/F 4.5 times bodyweight) and fails terminal half-life reproduction (paper 2.48 vs model 1.51), so it was held for review.**

The model does not reproduce the paper's terminal half-life (paper 2.48, model 1.51), and further half-life comparisons diverge widely (ratios from 0.0655 to 43.0318), partly because reported times in minutes or hours were compared against simulated hours. The absorption rate constant ka was not reported in the source and was defaulted, which the adjudication deemed not acceptable, and the unit 'times bodyweight' for V/F could not be converted to SI. The two readers also disagree on whether the apparent volume of distribution belongs to alfentanil (null vs 4.5) and on the clearance and volume of distribution values. Extracted — sufentanil: CL 11.3 ml/min/kg, V 0.39 L/kg, V/F 4.5 times bodyweight.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of alfentanil's apparent volume of distribution in adults: this record has none, the second reading 1.0; it also differs on 3 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['ka', 'Tlag', 'k12', 'k21']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)
- `invented_absorption`: ka defaulted — not reported in source
- `input_model`: first-order depot input — apparent (/F) parameterization ⇒ extravascular dosing

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped value-less row: 'apparent volume of distribution'
- salvaged Q22 ('clearance'=11.3) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q61 ('volumes of distribution'=0.39) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q76 ('apparent volume of distribution'=4.5) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=sufentanil
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- text-pointer recovery: parsed 1 structural record(s) from the flattened table i sentence
- LLM region Davis_1986:other_prose: no JSON records returned
