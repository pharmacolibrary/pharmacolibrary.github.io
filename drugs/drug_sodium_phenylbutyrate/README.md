## About

**Description.** Phenylbutyric acid is a fatty acid and a derivative of [butyric acid] naturally produced by colonic bacteria fermentation. It demonstrates a number of cellular and biological effects, such as relieving inflammation and acting as a chemical chaperone.[A249035] It is used to treat genetic metabolic syndromes, neuropathies, and urea cycle disorders.[L386,L42105]

**Indication.** Phenylbutyric acid is used for the treatment of various conditions, including urea cycle
disorders, neonatal-onset deficiency, late-onset deficiency disease in patients with a history of hyperammonemic encephalopathy. Phenylbutyric acid must be combined with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, essential amino acid supplementation.[L386]

Phenylbutyric acid, as sodium phenylbutyrate, is used in combination with [tauroursodeoxycholic acid] to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in adults.[L42105,L43473]

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
