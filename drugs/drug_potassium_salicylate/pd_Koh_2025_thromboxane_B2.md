<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Acetylsalicylic acid (measured concentrations) drives name (in μg/L): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Plasma ASA concentration inhibits serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) via a turnover model in which ASA inhibits TXB2 production (kin = kout × R0) with an Emax function: Imax fixed at 1, IC50 fixed at 0.0036 mol/L, gamma fixed at 1, and estimated kout of 0.023 h−1 with baseline R0 of 26.4 μg/L.

- **paper:** `Koh_2025`
- **model family:** `sigmoid_emax`
