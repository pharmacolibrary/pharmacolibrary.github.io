## About

**Description.** Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder estimated to affect approximately one in 20 million individuals resulting in adverse symptoms associated with premature ageing: skeletal dysplasia, joint contractures, atherosclerosis, myocardial fibrosis/dysfunction, scleroderma-like cutaneous effects, lipoatrophy, alopecia, and a severe failure to thrive; HGPS is uniformly fatal.[A224379, A224384, A224389, A224394, A224399] Mechanistically, HGPS is underpinned by a single heterozygous C-to-T mutation at position 1824 of the _LMNA_ gene, which results in the accumulation of an aberrant farnesylated form of lamin A called progerin in the inner nuclear membrane.[A224379, A224394] Lonafarnib is a farnesyl transferase (FTase) inhibitor (FTI), which reduces the farnesylation of numerous cellular proteins, including progerin; as progerin farnesylation is important for localization to the nuclear membrane, lonafarnib inhibits progerin accumulation and improves symptoms in HGPS patients.[A224379, A224414, A224419, L23414]

Merck originally developed Lonafarnib and subsequently licensed it to Eiger Biopharmaceuticals Inc., which currently markets it under the trademark ZOKINVY™.[L23414, L23544] Lonafarnib was granted FDA approval on November 20, 2020, and is the first FDA-approved treatment for HGPS and other related progeroid laminopathies.[L23414, L23549]

**Indication.** Lonafarnib is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor indicated in patients aged 12 months and older with a body surface area of at least 0.39 m<sup>2</sup> to reduce the risk of mortality associated with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). It is also indicated in this same population for the treatment of processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies that either involve a heterozygous _LMNA_ mutation resulting in the accumulation of a progerin-like protein or homozygous/compound heterozygous mutations in _ZMPSTE24_.[L23414]

## Molecules and molar masses

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.
