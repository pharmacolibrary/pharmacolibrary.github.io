## About

**Description.** Zastaprazan is a small molecule drug. The usage of the INN stem '-prazan' in the name indicates that Zastaprazan is a proton pump inhibitor, not dependent on acid activation. Zastaprazan is under investigation in clinical trial NCT05814809 (Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of JP-1366 in Healthy Adult Volunteers). Zastaprazan has a monoisotopic molecular weight of 362.21 Da.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PGx | Cao_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates CYP3A-mediated metabolism and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) of zastaprazan, but does not report any pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants/genotypes) on its PK or PD parameters. |
| PGx | Denegri_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a narrative review of efficacy and general pharmacology, and does not report specific pharmacogenomic effects on PK or PD parameters for zastaprazan. |

| PD | Liu_2025 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a systematic review and meta-analysis focused exclusively on pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (AUC, Cmax, etc.) and drug interactions, with no pharmacodynamic (PD) or exposure-response modeling or numeric PD parameters reported. |
| PGx | Liu_2025 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a systematic review of drug-drug and food-drug interactions for P-CABs and does not report pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants) on PK/PD parameters. |
| PGx | Yang_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper explicitly states that CYP2C19 phenotypes had no significant effect on zastaprazan PK. |
