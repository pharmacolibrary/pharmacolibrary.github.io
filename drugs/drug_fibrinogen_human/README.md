## About

**Description.** Fibrinogen concentrate (human) is a hematological agent. It works by replacing a specific protein in the blood, fibrinogen (factor I), that helps with blood clotting.  It is a soluble plasma glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 340 kDa and is a physiological substrate for three enzymes: plasmin, factor XIIIa, and thrombin. It is indicated for the treatment of acute bleeding episodes in patients with both acquired and congenital fibrinogen deficiency, including afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia.[L41065]

**Indication.** Human fibrinogen is indicated for the treatment of acute bleeding episodes in patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency, including afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia.[L41065, L54973] It is also indicated for fibrinogen supplementation in bleeding patients with acquired fibrinogen deficiency.[L41065]

In combination with thrombin, it is used indicated as an adjunct to hemostasis for mild to moderate bleeding in adults undergoing surgery when control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques (such as suture, ligature, and cautery) is ineffective or impractical.[L12936, L12939]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
