## About

**Description.** Lanadelumab, also known as DX-2930, is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody designed for subcutaneous self-injection.[L4538] It is a fully human immunoglobulin, k-light-chain made in recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary cells.[L4537] It has been granted priority review, breakthrough therapy, and orphan drug designations for rare diseases based on the results of clinical trials.[A38676] Lanadelumab was approved for use in patients with hereditary angioedema by the FDA in August 2018,[L4537] followed by Health Canada in October 2018[L49226] and the EMA in November 2018.[L49221]

**Indication.** Lanadelumab is indicated for prophylaxis to prevent attacks in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with hereditary angioedema.[L45108,L49221] In Canada, it is indicated for use only in adults and adolescents.[L49226]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PGx | Marceau_2020 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates bradykinin kinetics in hereditary angioedema and mentions lanadelumab only to note a lack of effect on KLK-1-induced bradykinin formation in a specific patient group, without reporting pharmacogenomic effects on lanadelumab's PK or PD parameters. |
