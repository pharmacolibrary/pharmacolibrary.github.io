> **Species: horse.** This record comes from an animal study (horse), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**V1, V2, V3, CL, Q, kabs, t1/2α, t1/2β, t1/2γ, t1/2ka , Vss and MRT have no unit.**

Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. A reported unit could not be converted (Vss and MRT), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — quinidine: V1 0.63, V2 0.59, V3 3.68, CL 0.49, Q 2.87, kabs 1, Fab 36.4, t1/2α 0.06, … (+5).

Independently confirmed by `gpt-oss:120b`.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `needs_review` (reviewed 2026-10-05 09:31:07.503281+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-06 04:23:24.109307+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `quinidine sulfate dihydrate`, measured `quinidine`.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['Tlag']

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'V1' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV%')
- table section iiv: 'V2' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV%')
- table section iiv: 'V3' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV%')
- table section iiv: 'CL' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV%')

- table section iiv: 'CL3' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV%')
- table section iiv: 'Kabs' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV%')
- table section iiv: 'F' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV%')
- column 'units' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'CL3' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab1:row6:col2', 'tab1:row6:col3', 'tab1:row6:col4', 'tab1:row6:col5'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'steady-state volume of distribution' (Vss)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'Mean residence time' (MRT)
- implicit units: 'V1' → L (from the popPK convention: 'V1 is a volume of distribution. In population PK, volumes are typically reported in liters (L). The value 0.63 is consis')
- implicit units: 'V2' → L (from the popPK convention: 'V2 is a volume of distribution. Standard unit for volume parameters in PK is liters (L).')
- implicit units: 'V3' → L (from the popPK convention: 'V3 is a volume of distribution. Standard unit for volume parameters in PK is liters (L).')
- implicit units: 'CL' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'CL is plasma clearance. Standard unit for clearance in population PK is liters per hour (L/h). The value 0.49 is consist')
- implicit units: 'CL2' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'CL2 is an intercompartmental clearance. Standard unit for clearance parameters is liters per hour (L/h).')
- implicit units: 'Kabs' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'Kabs is an absorption rate constant. Standard unit for first-order rate constants is inverse hours (1/h).')
- implicit units: 'Half_life_alpha' → h (from the popPK convention: 'Half_life_alpha is a half-life. Standard unit for time parameters like half-life is hours (h).')
- implicit units: 'Half_life_Beta' → h (from the popPK convention: 'Half_life_Beta is a half-life. Standard unit for time parameters like half-life is hours (h).')

- implicit units: 'MRT (Mean residence time)' → h (from the popPK convention: 'MRT is a time parameter (Mean Residence Time). Standard unit is hours (h).')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=quinidine
- structure disagreement: deterministic 2C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

<p>Each archive holds the model source, a script that simulates it against the appropriate library, and a README describing both and how to run them.</p>
<p><b>FMI is two downloads.</b> The archive holds this record's parameters and its driver; the simulator itself is <code>PK_2C_enteral.fmu</code>, one compiled template shared by every model of this structure. Take the FMU once, keep it beside the script (or pass <code>--fmu PATH</code>). Running it reproduces the model-specific FMU exactly.</p>

<sub>Runs this record's model in the browser as WebAssembly. Sliders start at the extracted values; the reference check compares the browser's peak against the FMPy result recorded when the record was built, and is withheld once a value has been edited. Template `PK_2C_enteral` · parameters `Quinidine_Kuroda2024_reference_params.json` · controls `Quinidine_Kuroda2024_reference_sim_controls.json`. A slider marked *simulator value* is running on the template's own default because this record does not pin that parameter.</sub>
