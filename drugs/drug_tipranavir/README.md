## About

Tipranavir is a protease inhibitor antiviral used to treat HIV infection. It is an approved medicine authorised in the European Union for HIV, though it carries a boxed warning.

<summary>Badge legend — what each badge means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Arshad_2020 | irrelevant | 2 | 1 | This is a SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing prioritization paper; tipranavir is only one of many drugs compared via Cmax/EC50 ratios, with no population-PK disposition parameters (CL, V, ka) reported, and any PK values live in supplementary tables/figures not provided. |
| popPK | Koh_2010 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | In vitro HIV resistance selection study; tipranavir only appears as a comparator with EC50 resistance data, no PK parameters. |
| popPK | McCallister_2004 | irrelevant | 4 | 2 | Only fold-increase in exposure is reported; no CL, V, or population-PK parameter values are given in the evidence. |
| popPK | Naeger_2007 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | This is a virologic resistance analysis with no pharmacokinetic parameters for tipranavir reported. |
| popPK | Peatey_2010 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | In-vitro antimalarial activity study (EC50s), not a PK study reporting disposition parameters for tipranavir. |
| popPK | Tojo_2010 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | In-vitro antiviral drug-design study; tipranavir only appears as a comparator with no PK parameters. |
| popPK | Yedidi_2014 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | This is a structural/antiviral activity study; tipranavir appears only as a comparator with EC50 values, no PK parameters. |
