A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The camostat metabolite GBPA record was rejected: the volume of distribution V (1046) carries the unit 'h' instead of a volume unit, and the GBA metabolite is unlinked, plus a second reader disputes all five reported values.**

The structural parameter V for GBPA is reported as 1046 with unit 'h', a dimension mismatch for a volume of distribution, and its unit could not be converted to SI. The metabolism step from GBPA to GBA leaves GBA without a path from the administered dose, so the model structure is incomplete. A second reader also read different values for Cmax (273.9 vs 72.68), AUClast (464.8 vs 152.3), AUC∞ (477.5 vs 156.5), CL/F (179.6 vs 141.7) and Vd (977.8 vs 1046), so the extracted summary statistics are disputed. Extracted — GBPA: t1/2z 1.01 h, Cmax 72.7 ng/mL, AUClast 152 h × ng/mL, AUC∞ 156 h × ng/mL, CL/F 142 L/h, V 1.05e+03 h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[aucinf].value`: this record has 156.5, the second reading 477.5; it also differs on 4 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'gbpa' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'h × ng/mL' (AUClast)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'h × ng/mL' (AUC∞)
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Vd (h)' → Q61 (unit '[time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=GBPA
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'gbpa' subgroup of Kim_2023 (paper reports 2 populations: gba, gbpa)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Kosinsky_2022's review values (primary lacked it)
- removed gap-filled parent disposition (Q49): this record measures 'GBPA', not camostat, and reports no metabolite CL/V — the imported values describe a compartment this record did not measure

**Extraction notes:**
