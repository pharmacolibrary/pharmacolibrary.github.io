<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The model's terminal half-life (0.975 h) deviates from the paper's 0.6 h, and bioavailability and lag time were left at library defaults.**

The simulated terminal half-life of 0.975 h exceeds the paper's reported 0.6 h by a ratio of 1.6243, failing the tolerance check. The absolute bioavailability (F) and lag time (Tlag) were not extracted from the paper and were instead set to library placeholder values. A second reader disagreed on the dose compound, identifying it as camostat mesylate rather than camostat, and noted conflicting extractions for the absorption rate constant and bioavailability. Extracted — FOY-251: kabs 0.67 1/h, Fab 0.051, V 22.4 L, kel 1.22 1/h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has camostat, the second reading camostat mesylate; it also differs on 4 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by qwen3.8:27b-mtp-q8_0</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `camostat`, measured `FOY-251`.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['F', 'Tlag']

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section residual_error: 'b' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual error model')
- metabolite volume: 'Vd, L' Q63→Q61 for FOY-251 — it is 1-compartment, so its central volume is its only volume
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=FOY-251
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 5/5 row label(s) assigned, 6 linked by role
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures 'FOY-251', not camostat — the review values are the parent's
- derived CL=27.2792 L/h from Ke × V = CL (Q47 × Q61); not separately reported

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 1
