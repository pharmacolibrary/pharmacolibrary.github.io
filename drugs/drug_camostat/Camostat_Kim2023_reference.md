<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**GBA volume of distribution is recorded in hours instead of volume, and the parent drug lacks a defined metabolic link to GBPA.**

The volume of distribution for GBA is listed as 1046 h, a time unit that is dimensionally incorrect for a volume parameter. Additionally, the metabolic link from camostat mesylate to GBPA has no associated parameter, leaving the parent drug compartment structurally disconnected from the metabolite. Extracted — GBA: t1/2z 1.01 h, Cmax 72.7 ng/mL, AUClast 152 h × ng/mL, AUC∞ 156 h × ng/mL, CL/F 142 L/h, V 1.05e+03 h.

<sub>reviewed by qwen3.8:27b-mtp-q8_0</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `camostat mesylate`, measured `GBPA`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'gbpa' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- column 'gba' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'h × ng/mL' (AUClast)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'h × ng/mL' (AUC∞)
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Vd (h)' → Q61 (unit '[time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- implicit units: 'AUClast (h × ng/mL)' — the LLM proposed 'h × ng/mL', whose dimension does not fit Q74; left unset
- implicit units: 'AUCinf (h × ng/mL)' — the LLM proposed 'h × ng/mL', whose dimension does not fit Q17; left unset
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=GBPA
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- template fit: none — noncompartmental model — not a compartmental parent–metabolite model
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles (LLM): model_class=noncompartmental; 6/6 row label(s) assigned, 0 linked by role; re-tagged GBPA→GBA ×18
- molar mass: none of 1 PubChem candidate(s) is 'GBPA' (LLM) — left in mass units
- molar mass: none found for 'GBPA' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures 'GBPA', not camostat — the review values are the parent's

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
