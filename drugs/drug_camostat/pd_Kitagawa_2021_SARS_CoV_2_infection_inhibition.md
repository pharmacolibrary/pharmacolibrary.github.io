<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy)phenylacetic acid (GBPA) (measured concentrations) drives name (in unknown) (inhibition; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Plasma GBPA (the active metabolite of camostat mesylate) concentrations were linked to inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection via an EC50 of 178 nM, used to compute time above EC50 from predicted steady-state concentrations; the paper does not state a full PD model form (e.g., Emax or indirect effect), only this threshold-based EC50 metric.

> <sub>in the paper's terms — summarised by glm-5.3-flash from the paper's text; not checked by a person</sub>

- **paper:** `Kitagawa_2021`
- **model family:** `unknown`
- **driver:** `conc_no_pk`
- **tier:** descriptive
