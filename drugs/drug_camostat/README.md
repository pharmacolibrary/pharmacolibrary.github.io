## About

**Description.** Camostat mesylate, or FOY-305, is a synthetic serine protease inhibitor.[A193842,A193848] It was first described in the literature in 1981, as part of research on the inhibition of skin tumors in mice.[A198807] Camostat mesylate inhibits cholecystokinin, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and serine proteases, leading to it being investigated for multiple indications including the treatment of COVID-19.[A198771,A198777,A193800]

Camostat mesylate was first approved in Japan in January 2006.[L13197]

**Indication.** Camostat mesylate is indicated in Japan to treat chronic pancreatitis and drug induced lung injury.[A193845] It is also being investigated as a potential treatment for COVID-19.[A193800]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| popPK | Kreutzberger_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro virology study investigating the synergistic inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by camostat and apilimod, reporting EC50 values for antiviral efficacy rather than pharmacokinetic disposition parameters (CL, V, ka, etc.). |
| popPK | Mahoney_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on novel TMPRSS2 inhibitors (MM3122, VD2173) and uses camostat only as a comparator/control agent without reporting its specific pharmacokinetic parameters. |

| PGx | Wagoner_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports in vitro pharmacodynamic synergy of drug combinations against SARS-CoV-2 but does not investigate the impact of host gene variants or genotypes on the PK or PD of camostat. |
| PGx | Weiss_2021 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the potential of camostat to act as a perpetrator in drug-drug interactions (inhibition/induction of transporters/enzymes) and does not report any pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants) on its PK or PD parameters. |
| popPK | Yamamoto_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro mechanistic study on SARS-CoV-2 inhibition where camostat is only a comparator agent, and no pharmacokinetic parameters are reported. |
| popPK | Yuan_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro antiviral screening study where camostat is mentioned only as a comparator that was not detected in the primary screen, and no pharmacokinetic parameters for camostat are reported. |
| PD | Yuan_2020 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper does not mention camostat; it screens other FDA-approved drugs (bexarotene, cetilistat, diiodohydroxyquinoline, abiraterone) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. |
