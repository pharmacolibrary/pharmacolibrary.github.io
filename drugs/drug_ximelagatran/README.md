## About

**Description.** Ximelagatran is an anticoagulant intended to become a replacement for warfarin by overcoming the dietary restrictions, drug interaction, and monitoring issues associated with the former. In 2006, its manufacturer AstraZeneca announced that it would not attempt to market ximelagatran after reports of hepatotoxicity (liver damage) during trials, and to discontinue its distribution in countries where the drug had been approved.

**Indication.** For the treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
