A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**Accepted with a caveat: the covariate scenarios were not simulated.**

The base model was simulated, not the covariate effects the record defines.

Independently confirmed by `gpt-oss:120b`.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `accepted_with_caveats` (reviewed 2026-09-28 14:41:35.840946+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-02 17:26:29.863775+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)

**Interpretation flags:**
- salvaged Q49 ('k a (h -1 )'=0.182) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q290 ('V 1 /F (L)'=20.7) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q27 ('CL/F (L/h)'=18.3) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q82 ('V 2 /F (L)'=360) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q69 ('Q/F (L/h)'=12.7) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q83 ('ALAG (h)'=0.228) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=telmisartan
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 1
