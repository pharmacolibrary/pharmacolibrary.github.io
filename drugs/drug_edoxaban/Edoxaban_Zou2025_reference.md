A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**The edoxaban pediatric model was quarantined because clearance, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time had no source values, so placeholder numbers stood in for these parameters instead of the reported ones.**

Although the paper reports edoxaban values such as CL/F 42.87 L/h, Ka 3.71 1/h, V1/F 261 L, Q/F 8.59 L/h and V2/F 343.5 L, the built model left clearance, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time without extracted values, so library placeholder numbers were used and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number; the absorption rate constant was judged an invented value not reported in the source. The model also assumed F=1 and Fm=1 with no molar correction (apparent parameterization). In addition, the covariate effects defined in the record (body-weight power and eGFR, theta 0.268) were not exercised: only the reference individual was simulated. Extracted — edoxaban: CL/F 42.9, kabs 3.71, V1/F 261 L, Q/F 8.59 L/h, V2/F 344 L, ktr 47.5.

**Model structure:** 2-compartment, oral mammillary model — template `PK_2C_enteral`.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, Q/F, V1/F, V2/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `model_quarantined`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped PD-category row 'Hill coefficient of maturation function, HILL' → Q325 (Hill, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['psp413248-tbl-0001:row8:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Post‐menstrual age (PMA) at half max of the maturation function, TM50' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp413248-tbl-0001:row9:col1'])
- covariate effect for Q319 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- covariate effect for Q22 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=edoxaban
- structure disagreement: deterministic 2C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
