<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for lamotrigine's bioavailability, volume of distribution and absorption lag time.**

The model was built, but lamotrigine's bioavailability, volume of distribution and absorption lag time had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. A reported unit could not be converted (sigma), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — lamotrigine: kabs 1.93 h -1, CL 2.44 L/h, sigma 0.3 multiplicative, CV.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[σ 1].parameter_id`: this record has Q315, the second reading Q316. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Peripregnancy stage2' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_3:row5:col3', 'tab_3:row5:col5'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Peripregnancy stage3' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_3:row7:col3', 'tab_3:row7:col5'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Peripregnancy stage4' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_3:row9:col3', 'tab_3:row9:col5'])
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('BW on CL (L/h)', value '0.92') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'multiplicative, CV' (sigma)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=lamotrigine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
