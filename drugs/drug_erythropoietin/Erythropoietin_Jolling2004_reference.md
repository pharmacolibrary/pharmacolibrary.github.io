<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The erythropoietin record was rejected because its clearance (0.728 mL/h) and volumes (V1 15.8 mL, V2 6.99 mL) fall outside the physiological window, indicating a unit or scale extraction error.**

The record was built from the paper's abstract only, so reported summary statistics stood in for a fitted model. The plausibility check flagged the clearance and volume magnitudes as implausible, consistent with a unit/scale extraction error. A second reader also disputed the dose compound and primary analyte naming (pegylated human erythropoietin vs PEG-EPO) and could not confirm the bioavailability (48.8%), clearance (0.728 mL/h), absorption rate constant (0.0618 h⁻¹), intercompartmental clearance (0.373 mL/h) and lag time (3.13 h) values. Extracted — pegylated human erythropoietin: CL 0.728 mL/h, V1 15.8 mL, Q 0.373 mL/h, V2 6.99 mL, kabs 0.0618 h(-1), tlag 3.13 h, Fab 48.8 %.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has pegylated human erythropoietin, the second reading PEG-EPO; it also differs on 9 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=pegylated human erythropoietin
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Jolling_2004_metadata.yaml (14 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
