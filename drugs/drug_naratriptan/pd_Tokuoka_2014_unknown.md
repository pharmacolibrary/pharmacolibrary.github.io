<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Receptor occupancy (5-HT1B/1D) drives headache relief (in percent): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Naratriptan, a 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist, was related to headache relief rate (%) via 5-HT1B/1D receptor occupancy (Φ1B, Φ1D) derived from plasma concentrations, analyzed with a sigmoid Emax model (E = headache relief rate, EC50 = occupancy-AUC giving 50% of Emax, γ = Hill coefficient); the paper does not report naratriptan-specific Emax, EC50, or γ values, nor kin/kout/ke0, and states only that high occupancy (Φmax1B 32.0–89.4%, Φmax1D 68.4–96.2% across triptans) appears necessary for clinical effect.
