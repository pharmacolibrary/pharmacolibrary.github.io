<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Bocchini_2016 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies STAT3 protein stability and function in AD-HIES, not the pharmacokinetics of teprenone. |
| PGx | Bocchini_2016 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the effect of chaperone modulators on STAT3 mutations in hyper-IgE syndrome and does not mention teprenone. |
| popPK | Harada_1994 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | no_text gate: only 102 chars of text extracted (&lt; 400) |
| PD | Harada_1994 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the receptor binding profile of KB-5492, not teprenone, and does not report pharmacodynamic exposure-response or dose-response relationships for teprenone. |
| popPK | Iwakiri_2014 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a clinical trial assessing the efficacy of rabeprazole versus teprenone for peptic ulcer prevention, and it does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters for teprenone. |
| PD | Iwakiri_2014 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical trial comparing rabeprazole and teprenone for ulcer prevention; it reports clinical efficacy rates but contains no pharmacokinetic data, concentration-effect analysis, or numeric PD parameters for teprenone. |

| popPK | Song_2008 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | Teprenone is used only as an internal standard for vitamin K(1) analysis, not as the subject drug for PK parameter estimation. |
| popPK | Sun_2017 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the neuroprotective effects of geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) in Alzheimer's disease models and does not involve teprenone or report any pharmacokinetic parameters. |
