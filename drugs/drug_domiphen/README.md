<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Biosca_2019 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro nanomedicine study focusing on liposome formulation and antimalarial activity, reporting no pharmacokinetic parameters for domiphen. |
| popPK | Chen_2006 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes an analytical HPLC method for quantifying domiphen in bioprocess intermediates, not a pharmacokinetic study of domiphen as a drug. |
| popPK | Goerke_2005 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes a bioprocess purification method using domiphen bromide as a reagent, not a pharmacokinetic study of domiphen as a drug. |
| popPK | Hu_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro antimicrobial study reporting MIC and MBC values, not a pharmacokinetic study with disposition parameters for domiphen. |
| PD | Hu_2021 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The paper reports antimicrobial susceptibility (MIC, MBC, MBEC50) and synergy (FIC) data, which are pharmacological endpoints but do not constitute a pharmacodynamic (exposure-response) model with parameters like Emax or EC50 for the drug's effect on a physiological target. |

| popPK | Xu_2024 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a mechanistic antimicrobial study focusing on domiphen's interaction with bacterial enzymes and membranes, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting disposition parameters. |
| PD | Xu_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes antimicrobial synergy and in vivo efficacy but does not report pharmacokinetic data or numeric exposure-response/dose-response parameters for domiphen. |
