## About

Vorapaxar is a platelet aggregation inhibitor used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients who have had a myocardial infarction. It is an approved medicine, though its marketing authorisation in the European Union has been withdrawn, so its use is now limited to other regions.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
