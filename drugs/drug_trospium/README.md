## About

**Description.** Trospium is an antispasmodic agent used to treat the symptoms of overactive bladder, a condition that causes the bladder muscles to contract uncontrollably.[L6208] An overactive bladder leads to an increased urge to urinate, frequent urination, and sometimes, loss of control over urination.[L6208]  Trospium is manufactured by _Indevus Pharmaceutical Inc._ and was granted FDA approval in 2007.[L6211]

**Indication.** Trospium is indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency.[L36823] It is also indicated in combination with [xanomeline] for the treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia.[L51629]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.
