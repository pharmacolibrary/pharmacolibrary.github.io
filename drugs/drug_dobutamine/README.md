## About

**Description.** A beta-1 agonist catecholamine that has cardiac stimulant action without evoking vasoconstriction or tachycardia. It is proposed as a cardiotonic after myocardial infarction or open heart surgery.

**Indication.** Indicated when parenteral therapy is necessary for inotropic support in the short-term treatment of patients with cardiac decompensation due to depressed contractility resulting either from organic heart disease or from cardiac surgical procedures.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| popPK | Piani_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on hemodynamic correlations in preeclampsia and mentions dobutamine only as a covariate for inotropic support, without reporting any pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| popPK | Romson_1999 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study reports hemodynamic and pharmacodynamic responses (heart rate, blood pressure, LV performance) to dobutamine, but does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance, volume of distribution, or half-life. |
| popPK | Sun_1997 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on myocardial oxygen consumption using [1-11C]acetate, with dobutamine used only as a pharmacological agent to alter hemodynamics, not as the subject of PK analysis. |
| popPK | Šíma_2015 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of phenobarbital, with dobutamine serving only as a co-administered drug to assess potential interactions, not as the subject drug. |
