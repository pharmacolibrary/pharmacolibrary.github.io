## About

**Description.** Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic derived from thebaine in Germany in 1917.[A178696] It is currently indicated as an immediate release product for moderate to severe pain and as an extended release product for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period.[Label] The first oxycodone containing product, Percodan, was approved by the FDA on April 12, 1950.[L6460]

**Indication.** Oxycodone is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain.[Label] There is also an extended release formulation indicated for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period.[Label]

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Ing_2012 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is a review of PK/PD modeling in analgesics that discusses oxycodone qualitatively but does not report original quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, etc.) for oxycodone. |
| PD | Ing_2012 | not_relevant | 2 | 0 | The paper is a mini-review that discusses PK/PD concepts and models for opioids, including oxycodone, but does not report specific numeric PD parameters (e.g., Emax, EC50) or extractable concentration-effect data for oxycodone in the provided text. |
| popPK | Jansen_2026 | relevant | 9 | 1 | The study reports population PK parameters for oxycodone, but the specific numeric values are located in the Supplemental Digital Content which is not provided. |
| popPK | Shram_2023 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study evaluates the abuse potential of esmethadone using oxycodone only as a positive control, and no quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, etc.) for oxycodone are reported in the provided text. |
| PD | Shram_2023 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper evaluates the abuse potential of esmethadone using oxycodone as a positive control, but it does not report any pharmacodynamic modeling, exposure-response analysis, or numeric PD parameters (e.g., EC50, Emax) for oxycodone itself. |
