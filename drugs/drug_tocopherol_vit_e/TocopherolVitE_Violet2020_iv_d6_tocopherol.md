**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The alpha-tocopherol record was rejected because the elimination rate constant (0.024, unit given only as 'Ke') failed a dimension check, and a second reader disputes nearly every reported value, including Cmax 0.48 vs 0.20 and half-life 30.0 vs 39.0 h.**

The elimination rate constant for alpha-tocopherol was reported with the unit 'Ke', which could not be converted to SI, so the parameter reached the model build without a usable SI value and failed the dimension check. A second reader disagrees on the dosed and measured compound (d6-α-tocopherol rather than alpha-tocopherol) and on almost all parameter values: Cmax 0.48 vs 0.20 µM, Tmax 7.7 vs 8.5 h, AUC0–72h 17.5 vs 8.6 µM×h, half-life 30.0 vs 39.0 h, elimination rate 0.024 vs 0.019, and a fractional absorption of 0.537 that this record lacks entirely. These conflicting readings leave the record's numbers unreliable. Extracted — alpha-tocopherol: kel 0.024 Ke, t1/2z 30 h, Cmax 0.48, tmax 7.7, AUCt 17.5.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has alpha-tocopherol, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 9 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'iv d6-α-tocopherol' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Elimination rate (Ke)' → Q47 (unit '[current] * [time]' vs ontology '1 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q19 ('AUC0–8h (µM × h)C', value '2.86') — already have one for this compound
- implicit units: 'Cmax (µM)A' — the LLM proposed 'µM', whose dimension does not fit Q32; left unset
- implicit units: 'Tmax (h)B' → h (from the paper text: "The parameter label in the input explicitly includes the unit: 'Tmax (h)B = 7.7'.")
- implicit units: 'AUC0–72h (µM × h)C' — the LLM proposed 'µM × h', whose dimension does not fit Q19; left unset
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=alpha-tocopherol
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'iv d6-α-tocopherol' subgroup of Violet_2020 (paper reports 2 populations: iv d6-α-tocopherol, po d3-α-tocopherol)
- molar mass: none found for 'tocopherol_vit_e' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- skipped review gap-fill of CL: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
- unparsed cell Violet_2020_table_2:row9:col4 = '67.5% ± 8.3%'
