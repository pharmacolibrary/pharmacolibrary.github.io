# tocopherol (vit E)

- **generic name:** tocopherol (vit E)
- **ATC codes:** `A11HA03`

## About

**Description.** Tocopherol exists in four different forms designated as α, β, δ, and γ. They present strong antioxidant activities, and it is determined as the major form of vitamin E. Tocopherol, as a group, is composed of soluble phenolic compounds that consist of a chromanol ring and a 16-carbon phytyl chain. The classification of the tocopherol molecules is designated depending on the number and position of the methyl substituent in the chromanol ring. The different types of tocopherol can be presented trimethylated, dimethylated or methylated in the positions 5-, 7- and 8-. When the carbons at position 5- and 7- are not methylated, they can function as electrophilic centers that can trap reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Tocopherols can be found in the diet as part of vegetable oil such as corn, soybean, sesame, and cottonseed.[A32436] It is currently under the list of substances generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in the FDA for the use of human consumption.[L2114]

**Indication.** Tocopherol can be used as a dietary supplement for patients with a deficit of vitamin E; this is mainly prescribed in the alpha form.[A32443] Vitamin E deficiency is rare, and it is primarily found in premature babies of very low birth weight, patients with fat malabsorption or patients with abetalipoproteinemia.[L2120]

Tocopherol, due to its antioxidant properties, is studied for its use in prevention or treatment in different complex diseases such as cancer,[A32436] atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases,[A32442] and age-related macular degeneration.[A32444]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
