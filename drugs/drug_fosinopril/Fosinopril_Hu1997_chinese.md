**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The fosinoprilat record was rejected because the fraction excreted unchanged (fe) is reported as 42.58 with the unit 'n = 12' — a sample count instead of a percentage — a dimension mismatch on a structural parameter.**

The fe parameter for fosinoprilat carries value 42.58 with unit verbatim 'n = 12', which is not a valid unit for a fraction excreted and could not be converted to SI, so the parameter reached the model builder without an SI value. The remaining fosinoprilat parameters (λ1 6.77 L/hr, kel 0.45 L/hr, t1/2α 0.39 hr, t1/2β 1.73 hr, t1/2γ 5.51 hr, V 2053 mL, Vss 5131 mL, AUC∞ 7761 ng·hr/mL, MRT 5.37 hr, CL 1124 mL/hr) are dimensionally consistent. The failure is confined to this one parameter's unit. Extracted — fosinoprilat: λ1 6.77 L/hr, kel 0.45 L/hr, t1/2α 0.39 hr, t1/2β 1.73 hr, t1/2γ 5.51 hr, V 2.05e+03 mL, Vss 5.13e+03 mL, AUC∞ 7.76e+03 ng · hr/mL, … (+3).

Independently confirmed by `gpt-oss:120b`.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-10-05 09:26:53.713669+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 06:29:47.178444+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'α (L/hr)' → Q67 (unit '[length] ** 3 / [time]' vs ontology '[mass] / [time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'β (L/hr)' → Q47 (unit '[length] ** 3 / [time]' vs ontology '1 / [time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'k10 (L/hr)' → Q47 (unit '[length] ** 3 / [time]' vs ontology '1 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q47 ('k10 (L/hr)', value '2.12') — already have one for this compound

- dropped duplicate Q65 ('Vdss (mL/kg)', value '73.67') — already have one for this compound

- dropped duplicate Q22 ('ClNR (mL/hr/kg)', value '9.41') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 12' (fe)
- metabolite volume: 'Vc (mL)' Q63→Q61 for fosinoprilat — it is 1-compartment, so its central volume is its only volume
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=fosinoprilat
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- template fit: PK_3M_9C — formed from central; parent 0, metabolites [1]
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'chinese (n = 12)' subgroup of Hu_1997 (paper reports 2 populations: caucasian (n = 9), chinese (n = 12))
