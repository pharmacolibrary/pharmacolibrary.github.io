## About

Rolapitant is an antiemetic used to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with cancer treatment. It has been approved as a medicine, though its marketing authorisation in the European Union has been withdrawn.

<small>Summary written by `glm-5.3-flash` from [Wikidata Q76415423](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76415423) and the WHO ATC classification and the EMA medicines list; not checked by a person.</small>

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
