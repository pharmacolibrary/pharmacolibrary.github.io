<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The rolapitant parent–metabolite record was rejected because the peripheral volume V2 (164 L) was neither emitted nor defaulted, the model output was the parent compartment instead of the measured analyte, and the structure was reduced to a one-compartment model with an invented ka.**

The paper's topology is a parent–metabolite model (rolapitant metabolizing to M19), but the built model used a one-compartment enteral structure, and the model output was the parent central compartment rather than the measured analyte compartment. Of the four expected parameters, only three were covered: V2 (164 L) was missing, while ka and Tlag were left at library defaults because the abstract-only source did not report them. The builder also assumed F=1 and Fm=1 without molar correction and invented a first-order absorption rate not present in the source, which was judged unacceptable. Extracted — rolapitant: CL/F 0.962 L/h, V1 214 L, Q 2.79 L/h, V2 164 L, CLm/F 1.83 L/h.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['ka', 'Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)
- `invented_absorption`: ka defaulted — not reported in source
- `input_model`: first-order depot input — apparent (/F) parameterization ⇒ extravascular dosing

**Interpretation flags:**
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=rolapitant
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- engineer: parent → metabolite not buildable on PK_3M_9C (None) — the measured compound's 1-compartment model instead

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Wang_2019_metadata.yaml (5 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
