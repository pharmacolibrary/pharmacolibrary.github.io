A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**V1 and V have no unit.**

Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. A reported unit could not be converted (V1 and V), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — montelukast: V1 14 %CV, V 45.4 %CV, CL 0.87 L/h, kabs 0.357 h-1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of central compartment volume of distribution: this record has 14.0, the second reading none; it also differs on 6 more fields. That field does not shape the model.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `needs_review` (reviewed 2026-09-28 14:39:05.850029+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-03 22:16:42.751452+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Patients' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Li_2019_table_1:row0:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Gender' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Li_2019_table_1:row1:col1'])
- dropped value-less row: 'Age (years)' (captured trailing unit 'years' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'Body weight (kg)' (captured trailing unit 'kg' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'Montelukast dose (mg)' (captured trailing unit 'mg' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'Montelukast concentrations (ng/mL)' (captured trailing unit 'ng/mL' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'Montelukast clearance (L/h)' (captured trailing unit 'L/h' for child rows)
- salvaged Q63 ('central compartment volume of distribution (Vc)'=14.0) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q64 ('peripheral volume of distribution (Vp)'=45.4) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q22 ('Montelukast clearance (L/h)'=0.87) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- implicit units: 'central compartment volume of distribution (Vc)' → L (from the popPK convention: 'The paper does not explicitly state the unit for Vc in the provided text (it only lists the %CV). However, Vc is a volum')
- implicit units: 'peripheral volume of distribution (Vp)' → L (from the popPK convention: 'The paper does not explicitly state the unit for Vp in the provided text (it only lists the %CV). However, Vp is a volum')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=montelukast
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Zhu_2024's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell Li_2019_table_1:row2:col3 = '4.0 (0.7–10.0)'
- unparsed cell Li_2019_table_1:row3:col3 = '17.8 (7.0–49.0)'
