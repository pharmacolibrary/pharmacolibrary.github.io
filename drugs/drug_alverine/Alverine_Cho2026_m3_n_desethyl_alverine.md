> **Species: mouse.** This record comes from an animal study (mouse), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The alverine record in mice was rejected because it reports only exposure metrics (tmax 0.7000 h, Cmax 0.0021 μmol/L, AUClast 0.0036 μmol·h/L) with no distribution volume or clearance, plus a dimension mismatch and unlinked metabolites.**

The paper reports no distribution volume and no clearance or elimination rate for alverine, so it is an exposure/outcome paper rather than a compartmental population PK model. The metabolites M1, M2 and M3 have no compartments (n_cmt 0), leaving unreachable or unlinked metabolites, and a structural parameter failed a dimension check. The unit 'Metabolite/Parent' on the AUC ratio (0.0064 for M3) could not be converted to SI. A second reader disagreed on the dose compound and primary analyte (alverine) and on whether tmax, Cmax and AUClast values belong to the record. Extracted — alverine: tmax 0.7 h, Cmax 0.0021 μmol/L, AUClast 0.0036 μmol·h/L; M3: AUC ratio 0.0064 Metabolite/Parent.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has alverine, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 7 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Cmax (μmol/L)' → Q32 (unit '[substance] / [length] ** 3' vs ontology '[mass] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'AUClast (μmol·h/L)' → Q74 (unit '[substance] * [time] / [length] ** 3' vs ontology '[mass] * [time] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'Metabolite/Parent' (AUC ratio)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=alverine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: 3 first-order transfer(s) across 4 compounds → general_linear
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment (site hepatic: 'Beyond PBPK modeling, semi‐physiological population PK approaches have incorporated presystemic metabolite formation usi')
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'm3 (n‐desethyl alverine)' subgroup of Cho_2026 (paper reports 7 populations: estimate, m1, m1 (4‐hydroxy alverine), m2 (4‐hydroxy alverine glucuronide), m3 (n‐desethyl alverine), parent (alverine), po)
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 32/32 row label(s) assigned, 43 linked by role; re-tagged parent→M1 ×11, parent→M3 ×10, parent→M2 ×5, M1→parent ×3, M2→parent ×5, M3→parent ×3
- molar mass: no plausible PubChem entry for 'M3' ('N-desethyl alverine') — left in mass units
- molar mass: none of 1 PubChem candidate(s) is 'M2' (LLM) — left in mass units
- molar mass: none found for 'M2' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- molar mass: none found for 'M3' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
