## About

Alverine is an antispasmodic drug used to relieve symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. It remains in use, mainly for digestive complaints, and is available in several countries, though it is not authorised centrally in the European Union.

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | El_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study evaluates the antispasmodic activity of a seaweed extract using alverine only as a reference comparator in in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacological models, without reporting any pharmacokinetic parameters for alverine. |
| PD | El_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper evaluates a seaweed extract (Cystoseira compressa) and only qualitatively compares its profile to alverine; it does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response data for alverine itself. |
| popPK | Lee_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a mechanistic study on HNF4α agonists (NCT/NFT) for liver fat clearance, where alverine is only mentioned as a weak structural analog/comparator, and no pharmacokinetic parameters for alverine are reported. |
| popPK | Rizea-Savu_2020 | relevant | 9 | 2 | The study reports non-compartmental PK parameters (AUC, t1/2, etc.) for alverine and its metabolites in humans, but the specific numeric values are contained in Table 3 and Figure 1, which are not included in the provided evidence. |
