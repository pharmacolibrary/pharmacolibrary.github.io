A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

### Reviewer guidance

**The maximum metabolic rate for adefovir uses micromoles per hour, a unit not recognized by the review process.**

The Vmax parameter for adefovir is reported as 2.40 µmol/h. This specific unit could not be resolved to standard SI units during the review. As a result, the structural parameter check failed due to a dimension mismatch. Extracted — adefovir dipivoxil: tlag 0.122 h, FR 0.59, kabs 5.18 h−1; adefovir: V 235 L, CLm/F 11.8 L/h, Km 170 nmol/L, Vmax 2.4 µmol/h.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-10-07 14:32:43.430124+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 15:04:54.761012+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `adefovir dipivoxil`, measured `adefovir`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'V' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-individual variability (CV%)')
- table section iiv: 'Vmax' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-individual variability (CV%)')
- table section iov: 'F' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-occasion variability (CV%)')
- table section iov: 'Ka' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-occasion variability (CV%)')
- table section iov: 'ALAG' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-occasion variability (CV%)')
- table section iov: 'V' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-occasion variability (CV%)')
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Km (nmol/L)' → Q1 (unit '[substance] / [length] ** 3' vs ontology '[mass] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Vmax (µmol/h)' → Q66 (unit '[substance] / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- metabolite adefovir: Q22→Q351 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- metabolite volume: 'V (L)' Q63→Q61 for adefovir — it is 1-compartment, so its central volume is its only volume
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=adefovir
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles: 2 per-group rows of adefovir other but 2 reference group(s) — kept as printed
- row roles: per-genotype parameters — typical value from the reference group: FR, KaR (h−1)
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 16/16 row label(s) assigned, 8 linked by role
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures 'adefovir', not adefovir_dipivoxil — the review values are the parent's
