<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Ternary complex (Complex3) (measured concentrations) drives name (in cells/µL): indirect response — drug inhibits the loss of name.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Ternary complex (Complex3) concentration (nM) from anti-cyCD79b/CD3 TDB drives depletion of peripheral CD20+ B lymphocyte counts (cells/µL) via an indirect response model in which the complex stimulates the loss/elimination rate of B cells, with Emax 221 (% maximum increase in elimination rate) and EC50 1.20 nM; B cell turnover was fixed at kout = 0.0126 1/day (half-life 55 days), with baseline given by kin/kout.

- **paper:** `Yadav_2022`

The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.
