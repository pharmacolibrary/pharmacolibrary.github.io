<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Gemcitabine (concentrations from the PK model of Doi_2017) drives tumor volume (in unknown): delayed effect through an effect compartment.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Gemcitabine plasma concentration (from a cited one-compartment mouse PK model, kPK = 1/0.0167 day^-1, VPK = 0.115 L/kg) drives tumor volume V via an effect-compartment Minimal model: dCeff/dt = -α(Ceff - C), and dV/dt combines a proportional growth-suppression term (1 - Ceff/(Ceff + IC50)) with a linear cell-kill term (-k·Ceff·V). Fitted values include IC50 = 0.0043 µM, k = 0.24 (day·µM)^-1, and α = 0.45 day^-1 (with variant estimates such as IC50 = 67 µM for the Heaviside extension and IC50 = 0.0042 µM, k = 0.25, α = 0.46 for the Cooperative extension).
