<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for mazindol's clearance and volume of distribution.**

The model was built, but mazindol's clearance and volume of distribution had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. Extracted — mazindol: tlag 0.3 h, kabs 1.01 h−1.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="mazindol" model-id="Mazindol_Konofal2014_basic_model" status="model_quarantined" stale="false" population="children with ADHD" measured-compound="mazindol" parameterization="apparent" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment, oral mammillary model — template `PK_1C_enteral`.  
**Parameters:** 2 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `model_quarantined`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('CL/F= CLref* (FFMi/28)θ1', value None) — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q76 ('V/F= V/Fref* (Agei/10)θ2', value None) — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q76 ('V/F', value '24.5') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('CL/F', value '31.8') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=mazindol
- bound model equation to Q27 (CL/F): CL/F = CLref* (FFMi/28)^θ1
- bound model equation to Q76 (V/F): V/F = V/Fref* (Agei/10)^θ2
- Q27 (CL/F) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'CL/F (L h−1)'; equation kept verbatim
- Q76 (V/F) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'V/F (L)'; equation kept verbatim
- population split: 'basic model' subgroup of Konofal_2014 (paper reports 2 populations: basic model, final model)

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 3
- captured model equation CL/F = CLref* (FFMi/28)^θ1
- captured model equation V/F = V/Fref* (Agei/10)^θ2
