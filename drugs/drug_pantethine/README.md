## About

**Description.** Pantethine is a naturally occurring compound synthesized in the body from pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) via addition of cysteamine. It consists of two molecules of pantetheine that form a dimer via disufide linkages, and acts as an intermediate in the production of Coenzyme A. Coenzyme A plays an essential role as a cofactor in the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates including fatty acid oxidation, carbohydrate metabolism, pyruvate degradation, and amino acid catabolism [A27255]. Pantethine is available as a dietary supplement for lowering blood cholesterol and triglycerides.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PD | Arsenio_1987 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper reports qualitative clinical outcomes (reduction in lipids) after a fixed dose but provides no concentration-effect data, PK/PD modeling, or numeric PD parameters. |
| PD | Donati_1986 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper reports clinical efficacy (lipid changes) in a small cohort but provides no concentration-effect data, dose-response curve, or numeric PD parameters (Emax, EC50, etc.). |
| PD | Eto_1987 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The paper reports clinical outcomes (changes in beta-TG and lipids) for two fixed doses but does not provide plasma concentration data or fit a pharmacodynamic model to derive numeric PD parameters like Emax or EC50. |
| PD | Gentili_1985 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The text provides only a qualitative summary of pharmacological effects (e.g., "more durable reduction," "more pronounced activity") without reporting any numeric concentration-effect data, dose-response curves, or PD parameters. |
| PD | Ligas_1983 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The text is a brief summary of a clinical trial reporting qualitative therapeutic outcomes and safety, with no mention of pharmacokinetic data, exposure-response analysis, or numeric pharmacodynamic parameters. |
| PD | Naruta_2001 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper reports qualitative effects of pantethine on lipid parameters in a mouse model but provides no concentration-effect data, dose-response curves, or numeric PD parameters. |
| PGx | Pereira_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the therapeutic efficacy of pantethine in PKAN patients, not the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic effects of genetic variants on pantethine metabolism. |
| PGx | Rothmann_2013 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the metabolic flexibility of CoA biosynthesis in E. coli using a synthetic analog, not the pharmacogenomics of pantethine in humans. |
| PGx | van_2017 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the neuroprotective effects of pantethine in an Alzheimer's disease model but does not report any pharmacogenomic effects on pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters. |
