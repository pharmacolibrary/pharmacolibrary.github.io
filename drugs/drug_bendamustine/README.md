## About

Bendamustine is an alkylating anticancer drug used to treat blood cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and several types of lymphoma, including mantle cell and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is an approved medicine and appears on the WHO list of essential medicines, so it is widely used in cancer care.

<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| popPK | Gibiansky_2019 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab, with bendamustine serving only as a co-administered agent in the treatment regimen. |
| popPK | Gisleskog_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib, with bendamustine serving only as a co-administered comparator agent in the background therapy. |
| PD | Gisleskog_2025 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper analyzes the exposure-response relationship for ibrutinib, not bendamustine, and does not provide numeric PD parameters for bendamustine. |

| popPK | Lavezzi_2019 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study focuses on rituximab PK modeling and only states that bendamustine exposure was comparable without providing quantitative PK parameters for bendamustine. |
| popPK | Liao_2024 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the clinical pharmacology of polatuzumab vedotin, with bendamustine serving only as a co-administered comparator agent in the treatment regimen, and no PK parameters for bendamustine are reported. |

| PD | Owen_2010 | not_relevant | 3 | 1 | The study reports a significant correlation between Cmax and nausea probability but explicitly states no correlation was observed for efficacy or other safety measures due to limited exposure range, and no numeric PD parameters (Emax, EC50, etc.) are provided. |
| popPK | Purvis_2023 | relevant | 9 | 4 | The study is a population PK analysis of bendamustine, but the evidence only provides summary statistics (AUC, Cmax) and qualitative covariate effects, lacking specific numeric values for clearance, volume, or half-life. |
