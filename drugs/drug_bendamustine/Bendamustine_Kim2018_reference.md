<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for bendamustine's clearance, volume of distribution, central→peripheral rate constant and peripheral→central rate constant.**

The model was built, but bendamustine's clearance, volume of distribution, central→peripheral rate constant and peripheral→central rate constant had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. Extracted — bendamustine: V1 14.9, CL 32.5, V2 0.508, Q 0.238, V3 0.323, Q3 0.793.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'bootstrap replicates' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped duplicate Q30 ('Q2', value '0.569') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'V4' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab2:row8:col1', 'Tab2:row8:col2', 'Tab2:row8:col3', 'Tab2:row8:col4', 'Tab2:row8:col5'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'CLcsf' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab2:row10:col1', 'Tab2:row10:col2', 'Tab2:row10:col3', 'Tab2:row10:col4', 'Tab2:row10:col5'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'RV' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab2:row13:col1', 'Tab2:row13:col2', 'Tab2:row13:col3', 'Tab2:row13:col4', 'Tab2:row13:col5'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=bendamustine
- structure disagreement: deterministic 2C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
