The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

<dbs-pgx drug="quinine" model-id="Quinine_Dyer1994v2_non_diabetics" status="needs_review" stale="false" population="elderly diabetic and non-diabetic adults" measured-compound="quinine" parameterization="apparent" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 6 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, Vnorm/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'CL/F' from footnote/prose loose number 1.07 (source ['tab_0:footnote', 'tab_0:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'fu' from footnote/prose loose number 19 (source ['tab_0:footnote', 'tab_0:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- implicit units: 'Volume of distribution (V/F) 1 kg-1' → L/kg (from the paper text: 'Table 2 lists volume of distribution normalized per kg body weight (V/F 1 kg-1), i.e. L/kg.')
- implicit units: 'Absorption lag-time (t_lag) h' → h (from the paper text: "Table 2 shows absorption lag-time in h (t_lag h = 1.0); abstract also reports 'mean absorption lag-time of approximately")
- implicit units: 'Absorption half-time (t_1/2,abs) h' → h (from the paper text: 'Table 2 lists absorption half-time in h (t1/2,abs h = 0.6).')
- implicit units: 'Maximum concentration (C_max) mg 1-1' → mg/L (from the paper text: 'Table 2 gives Cmax as mg 1-1 (mg/L); assay concentrations reported in mg l-1.')
- implicit units: 'Elimination half-time (t_1/2,l) h' — the LLM proposed 'h', whose dimension does not fit Q67; left unset
- implicit units: 'Systemic clearance (CL/F) ml kg-1 min-1' → mL/kg/min (from the paper text: 'Table 2 states Systemic clearance (CL/F) ml kg-1 min-1 = 1.07.')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=quinine
- population split: 'non-diabetics' subgroup of Dyer_1994_2 (paper reports 2 populations: diabetics, non-diabetics)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
