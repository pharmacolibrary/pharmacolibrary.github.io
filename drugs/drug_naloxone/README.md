## About

**Description.** Naloxone is an opioid antagonist medication used to block or reverse the effects of opioid drugs, particularly within the setting of drug overdoses which are rapidly becoming a leading cause of death worldwide.[A234594] More specifically, naloxone has a high affinity for μ-opioid receptors, where it acts as an inverse agonist, causing the rapid removal of any other drugs bound to these receptors.[A234594] When taken in large quantities, opioid medications such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [methadone], [heroin], or [fentanyl] are capable of causing life-threatening symptoms such as respiratory depression, reduced heart rate, slurred speech, drowsiness, and constricted pupils.[A234594,L33724] If untreated, this can progress to vomiting, absent pulse and breathing, loss of consciousness, and even death.[L33724] Naloxone is indicated for the rapid reversal of these symptoms of central nervous system depression in opioid overdose.[A234589] It's important to note that naloxone only works on opioid receptors within the body, and is therefore not capable of reversing the effects of non-opioid medications such as stimulants like [methamphetamine] or [cocaine], or benzodiazepines like [lorazepam] or [diazepam]. 

Also known as the brand name product Narcan, naloxone is currently available by intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection, nasal spray, or intravenous (IV) infusion.[L33729,L33739] Naloxone IM injections are commonly available in the form of "kits", which is ideal for making overdose treatment accessible and readily available for administration by minimally trained individuals within the community.[L33734] Kits commonly include the supplies necessary to treat an overdose in a non-medical setting such as alcohol swabs, syringes, a rescue breathing mask, and instructions for use. Frequently also carried by medical and emergency personnel and at events known to be associated with heavy drug use like music festivals, naloxone kits are considered a key comp

**Indication.** Naloxone nasal sprays are indicated for the reversal of an opioid overdose or suspected opioid overdose: it is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where opioids may be present.[L33694,L45515] Intramuscular, intravenous, and subcutaneous injections are indicated for complete or partial reversal of opioid depression, diagnosis of known or suspected opioid overdose, and as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of septic shock.[L33739]

Sublingual tablets and films are formulated with [buprenorphine] for the treatment of opioid dependence.[L33714,L33719] Naloxone is also formulated with [pentazocine] as an oral tablet for severe pain.[L33744]

Intramuscular or subcutaneous naloxone autoinjectors are used for the emergency treatment of people 12 years of age and older where the use of high-potency opioids such as fentanyl analogues as a chemical weapon, is suspected.[L40758, L40763]

Naloxone has been used off-label for the treatment of neuraxial opioid-induced pruritus.[A234604]
