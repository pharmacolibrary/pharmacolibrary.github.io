The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label (paper)</code></td><td>the row or statistic label exactly as printed in the paper (label_verbatim) — never normalised, so it can be found in the PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Q-code · name</code></td><td>the ontology parameter this label was matched to (Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F, Q49 = ka, Q57 = half-life, …) and its canonical name. The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)

**Interpretation flags:**
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=praziquantel
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- population split: 'median' subgroup of Bustinduy_2016 (paper reports 4 populations: mean, median, r-pzq, s-pzq)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- transposed table Bustinduy_2016_table_2: parameters were across the columns, populations/subgroups down the first column — transposed for parsing
- companion parameter table 2 transcribed (16 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2, 3

<p><b>FMI is two downloads.</b> The archive holds this record's parameters and its driver; the simulator itself is <code>PK_1C_enteral.fmu</code>, one compiled template shared by every model of this structure.
