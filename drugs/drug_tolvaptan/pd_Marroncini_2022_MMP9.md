<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Tolvaptan (concentrations from the PK model of Bhatt_2014) drives MMP9 activity (in normalized vs 0 µM) (inhibition; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Tolvaptan (µM concentrations, 48 h exposure) dose-dependently reduced MMP9 activity (type IV collagenase activity measured by zymography, normalized vs 0 µM) in HCT-8, HepG2 and SK-N-AS cancer cells, an inhibitory effect associated with blunted cell invasion; the paper does not report a specific PD model or potency parameters (Imax, IC50, etc.) for MMP9, and no mechanism beyond association with reduced invasion is given.

<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>second reader</code></td><td>a model that re-read the paper independently, always from a different family than the first reading (scholarv2.secondary_for): a qwen primary is checked by gpt-oss:120b, a gpt-oss primary by qwen3.8:27b-mtp-q8_0 — two checkpoints of one family share their misreads, so agreement between them would mean little. A record can have several readers.</td></tr><tr><td><code>agreement</code></td><td>share of the compared fields that reader agreed on.</td></tr><tr><td><code>verdict</code></td><td>per reader: `confirmed` it agrees throughout · `partly confirmed` a non-structural field differs · `not confirmed` a structural one differs (clearance, a volume, ka, a lag) · `primary re-run` the first reading extracted nothing and was given one hinted retry.</td></tr><tr><td><code>combined</code></td><td>the record's verdict over ALL its readers: confirmed only when every reader that answered agrees, disputed as soon as one disagrees on a structural parameter. The most favourable reading is never taken — an extra reader must not be a way to find one that agrees.</td></tr><tr><td><code>kept</code></td><td>which reading the record holds. ALWAYS the first — a disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction, so the numbers on this page are the first model's either way.</td></tr></tbody></table>
