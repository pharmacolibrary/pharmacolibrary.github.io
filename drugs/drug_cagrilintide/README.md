The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Al-Harbi_2025 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is a synthetic target trial emulation and predictive modeling study focused on efficacy and safety outcomes, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, Q, ka) for cagrilintide. |
| popPK | Lau_2021 | irrelevant | 2 | 1 | The paper is a clinical efficacy/safety trial for weight loss that only mentions a half-life of ~180 hours in passing, without reporting quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, Q, ka) or a compartmental/population-PK model. |
| PD | Lau_2021 | not_relevant | 2 | 0 | The text is a clinical trial protocol describing the *planned* dose-response and PK/PD modeling analyses, but it does not report the actual results, fitted models, or numeric PD parameters. |
| popPK | Ludwig_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a mechanistic neuroanatomy study using cagrilintide to identify neural mediators in the brainstem, and it does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, t1/2, etc.) for the drug. |
| PD | Ludwig_2026 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is a mechanistic study using transcriptomics and neuroanatomy to identify neural mediators of cagrilintide; it does not report pharmacokinetic data, exposure-response modeling, or numeric PD parameters (e.g., Emax, EC50). |
| popPK | Min_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of GLP-1 RAs (exenatide, liraglutide, etc.) and does not mention cagrilintide. |
| PD | Min_2025 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of GLP-1 RAs and tirzepatide, focusing on PK and DDIs; it does not mention cagrilintide or report any PD parameters for it. |
| popPK | Nong_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a network meta-analysis of clinical efficacy and safety outcomes (weight loss, adverse events) for obesity drugs, not a pharmacokinetic study, and contains no PK parameters for cagrilintide. |
| PD | Nong_2026 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is a systematic review and network meta-analysis of clinical outcomes (benefits/harms) for obesity drugs, not a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling study; it does not report specific exposure-response or dose-response PD parameters (e.g., Emax, EC50) for cagrilintide. |
