<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PD | Baek_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports in vitro enzyme inhibition data (IC50/Ki) for hispidol and sulfuretin, with toloxatone mentioned only as a qualitative comparator; it does not report a pharmacodynamic or exposure-response relationship for toloxatone. |
| PD | Baek_2018_2 | not_relevant | 1 | 2 | The paper reports in vitro IC50 and Ki values for chelerythrine and toloxatone, but these are static enzyme inhibition constants, not a pharmacodynamic exposure-response or dose-response relationship in a biological system. |
| PD | Baek_2019 | not_relevant | 1 | 2 | The paper reports a single in vitro IC50 value for toloxatone as a reference standard but does not provide a dose-response curve, PK/PD model, or exposure-response analysis. |
| PD | Baek_2019_2 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports on Rhamnocitrin, not toloxatone, and focuses on MAO-A inhibition kinetics rather than toloxatone PD. |
| PD | Bester_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports in vitro enzyme inhibition IC50 values for coumarin derivatives and mentions toloxatone only as a reference inhibitor without providing specific numeric PD parameters or exposure-response data for it. |
| PD | Dos_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper evaluates MAO-B inhibitors using immobilized enzymes on magnetic beads, which is an in vitro biochemical assay, not a pharmacodynamic or exposure-response study in a biological system. |
| PD | El-Halaby_2025 | not_relevant | 1 | 1 | The paper reports in vitro IC50 values for MAO inhibition, which are pharmacodynamic potency metrics, but does not provide an exposure-response or dose-response curve, Emax, or PK/PD modeling for toloxatone or the new compounds. |
| popPK | Kaltenbach_1999 | relevant | 9 | 4 | The study reports quantitative PK parameters (half-lives) for toloxatone in rabbits, but lacks explicit values for clearance, volume, or intercompartmental clearance. |
| PD | Lee_2017 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports in vitro IC50 and Ki values for natural compounds and mentions toloxatone only as a comparative benchmark for potency, without providing any pharmacokinetic data, exposure-response analysis, or dose-response curve for toloxatone. |
| PD | Pawa_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on flavokawain A and only mentions toloxatone as a reference compound for selectivity comparison, without providing any exposure-response or dose-response data for toloxatone. |
| popPK | Schoerlin_1989 | irrelevant | 2 | 1 | The paper is a review that provides only qualitative comparisons and general ranges (e.g., half-life 1-3 h) without specific quantitative PK parameters (CL, V, Q) for toloxatone. |
| popPK | Vandel_1993 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of amitriptyline (the subject drug) to assess interaction with toloxatone, and no quantitative PK parameters for toloxatone itself are reported. |
| PD | Zimmer_1990 | not_relevant | 3 | 2 | The paper provides qualitative comparisons and general ranges of MAO inhibition (e.g., 50-85%) and tyramine potentiation factors, but does not report specific numeric PD parameters (like EC50, Emax) or a fitted concentration-effect curve for toloxatone. |
