**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The ondansetron record was rejected because the reported clearance (0.58 L/h) and central volume (0.29 L) fall outside physiological plausibility for neonates, suggesting a unit or scale extraction error.**

For ondansetron in neonates with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, the two-compartment model reports total clearance of 0.58 L/h and a central volume of distribution of 0.29 L, magnitudes flagged as physiologically implausible and consistent with a unit or scale extraction error. The peripheral volume (0.91 L) and intercompartmental clearance (6.15 L/h) exceed the central volume, further straining the parameter set. The remaining parameters — absorption rate constant 0.19 h−1 and bioavailability 0.62 — were not themselves flagged. Extracted — ondansetron: CL 0.58 L/h, V 0.29 L, V2 0.91 L, Q 6.15 L/h, kabs 0.19 h−1, Fab 0.62.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has ondansetron, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'Variability (% CV): CL' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual')
- table section iiv: 'Residual error: Additive error (SD)' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual')
- column 'r^' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- column 'bulk ess' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- column 'tail ess' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'BCL' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['cts70147-tbl-0003:row7:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'TCL (months)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['cts70147-tbl-0003:row8:col1'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=ondansetron
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
