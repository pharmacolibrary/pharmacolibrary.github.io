## About

**Description.** Ergocalciferol is an inactivated vitamin D analog.[A177526] It is synthesized by some plants in the presence of UVB light.[T577] The production of ergocalciferol was prompted by the identification of dietary deficiency, more specifically vitamin D, as the main causative factor for the development of rickets. Ergocalciferol was isolated for the first time from yeast in 1931 and its structure was elucidated in 1932.[T580]

Ergocalciferol is considered the first vitamin D analog and is differentiated from [cholecalciferol] by the presence of a double bond between C22 and C23 and the presence of a methyl group at C24. These modifications reduce the affinity of ergocalciferol for the vitamin D binding protein resulting in faster clearance, limits its activation, and alters its catabolism.[A177637]

The first approved product containing ergocalciferol under the FDA records was developed by US Pharm Holdings and was FDA approved in 1941.[L6058]

**Indication.** Ergocalciferol is indicated for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism, refractory rickets, and familial hypophosphatemia.[FDA label]

Hypoparathyroidism is the result of inadequate parathyroid hormone production that occurs due to the presence of damage or removal of the parathyroid glands. This condition produces decreased calcium and increased phosphorus levels.[L6082]

Rickets is a condition produced due to a deficiency in vitamin D, calcium or phosphorus. However, this condition can also be related to renal diseases. It is characterized to present weak or soft bones.[A177664]

Familial hypophosphatemia is characterized by the impaired transport of phosphate and an altered vitamin D metabolism in the kidneys. The presence of this condition can derive in the presence of osteomalacia, bone softening and rickets.[L6085]
