<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The enalaprilat two-compartment model record was held back because the peripheral volume V2/F (108.26 L) was never extracted or given a value, and the apparent-parameter assumption (F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction) was judged unacceptable.**

Of the five expected parameters, only four were covered; V2/F, the apparent peripheral volume of distribution of enalaprilat, had no value extracted, so a library placeholder would have been used instead. The model also relies on deviations: a default Tlag instead of an explicit estimate, and bioavailability assumed to be 1 (F=1, Fm=1) without molar correction, so all reported clearances and volumes (CL/F 36.39 L/h, V1/F 223.71 L, Q/F 6.38 L/h, V2/F 108.26 L) are apparent rather than absolute. The deviation check on this apparent-parameter assumption failed adjudication, leading to the needs_review verdict. Extracted — enalaprilat: ktr 5.31 1/h, MTT 1.46, kabs 1.19 1/h, CL/F 36.4 L/h, V1/F 224 L, Q/F 6.38 L/h, V2/F 108 L.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="enalapril" model-id="Enalapril_Steichert2025v2_reference" status="needs_review" stale="false" population="healthy adults and children with heart failure" measured-compound="enalaprilat" parameterization="apparent" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment, oral mammillary model — template `PK_1C_enteral`.  
**Parameters:** 7 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, Q/F, V1/F, V2/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

<sub>Runs this record's model in the browser as WebAssembly. Sliders start at the extracted values; the reference check compares the browser's peak against the FMPy result recorded when the record was built, and is withheld once a value has been edited. Template `PK_1C_enteral` · parameters `Enalapril_Steichert2025v2_reference_params.json` · controls `Enalapril_Steichert2025v2_reference_sim_controls.json`. A slider marked *simulator value* is running on the template's own default because this record does not pin that parameter.</sub>
