## Exposure-response model

`Enalapril_Hockings1986_PD_ace_inhibition` — sigmoid_emax, `response = E0 + Emax*frac`

| parameter | value (paper units) | SI |
|---|---|---|
| E0 | 0 | — |
| Emax | -89.8 % | -0.898 1 |
| EC50 | 1.83 ng mt' | — |
| gamma | 1 | — |

Closed-form check points (response, SI): `at_0` = 0, `at_EC50` = -0.449, `at_inf` = -0.898

Deviations:

- `defaulted_parameters` — E0, gamma
- `pd_binding_inhibition_sign` — effect_direction=inhibition with a positive Emax (Q320) — sign flipped
- `pd_binding_exposure_unit_unresolved` — "ng mt'" — the x axis is in the paper's unit, not SI

## Review

Verdict <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span> · route to `scholar`

| check | status | note |
|---|---|---|
| `T0_driver` | pass | driver is the drug, a synonym or one of its metabolites (or unnamed) |
| `T1_closed_form` | pass | engineer's check points reproduced from the bound parameters |
| `T1b_fmu` | pass | shared PD_SigmoidEmaxSweep FMU reproduces the reference points (worst 0.16%) |
| `T2_direction` | pass | the response falls, as direct effect predicts |
| `T3_plausibility` | pass | EC50, gamma, Imax and baseline in range |
| `T4_defaults` | fail | a core parameter took a library default: E0 |

Advisory:

- defaulted: E0 — a row the paper has and the record lacks
- exposure unit not resolved to SI — the x axis is in the paper's unit
