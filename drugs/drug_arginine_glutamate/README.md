<summary>Badge legend — what each badge means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Cruz_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review on viscosity mitigation for high-concentration protein therapeutics (antibodies) and does not study arginine_glutamate or report any pharmacokinetic parameters for it. |
| PD | Cruz_2025 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review on formulation development and viscosity mitigation for biotherapeutics, containing no pharmacodynamic or exposure-response analysis for arginine glutamate. |
| popPK | Kernohan_2005 | irrelevant | 2 | 1 | The study reports only Cmax and Tmax for L-arginine (a component of the combination drug) and explicitly states that AUC and half-life were not calculated due to endogenous interference, failing to provide the quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, ka) required for population PK modeling. |
| PD | Kernohan_2005 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The study reports PK parameters and time-based hemodynamic changes (mean differences vs placebo) but does not provide a concentration-effect or dose-response model with numeric PD parameters (e.g., Emax, EC50) for arginine glutamate. |
| PD | Parkash_2002 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports the isolation and characterization of a plant-derived peptide (luffacylin) and its biological activity (IC50), but does not report a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic exposure-response relationship for the drug arginine glutamate. |
| PD | Sato_2000 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies electrophysiological responses to amino acids (including arginine and glutamate) and chloride channel blockers, but does not report a pharmacodynamic exposure-response relationship or numeric PD parameters for arginine glutamate. |
| PD | Wang_2002 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes the isolation and characterization of a novel peptide (Luffangulin) and does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response analysis for arginine glutamate. |
| PD | Wang_2003 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the isolation and characterization of a novel antifungal peptide (cucurmoschin) from pumpkin seeds, not on the pharmacodynamics of arginine glutamate. |
| PD | Wang_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports only population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (CL, V, Vmax, Km) and covariates, with no pharmacodynamic (PD) or exposure-response analysis. |
