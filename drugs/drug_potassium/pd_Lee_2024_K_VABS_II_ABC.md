<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** AST-001 (the dose) drives Korean-Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-II Adaptive Behavior Composite (in score): delayed effect through an effect compartment.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> AST-001 (L-serine syrup) dose, linked via a published population PK model, stimulates K-VABS-II-ABC scores in children with ASD through an effect-compartment model with a linear concentration-effect relationship (Deff 0.0022 L/μg; equilibration half-life ~15 weeks, Ke0 0.0065 1/day), plus linear disease progression (Kprog 0.015 1/day) from baseline E0 48.51; no Emax/IC50 values are given.
