<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** AK111 drives Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (in score): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> AK111 serum concentrations act on the PASI score via an indirect response (IDR) model with inhibition, chosen because PASI reduction showed a lag relative to peak concentration; the paper does not state the specific inhibited production/elimination process or any PD potency parameters (Imax, IC50, kin, kout) in the excerpts. Only PK parameters are reported (Ka 0.463 1/day, CL 0.182 L/day, V 6.65 L).
>
> <sub>in the paper's terms — summarised by glm-5.3-flash from the paper's text; not checked by a person</sub>

- **paper:** `Li_2022_2`
- **model family:** `indirect_response_i`
- **driver:** `not_resolved`
