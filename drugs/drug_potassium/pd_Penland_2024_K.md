## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (virtual exposure) (the dose) drives serum potassium (in mmol/L): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of serum potassium.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) dose inhibits the zero-order production rate (Kin) of serum potassium (K+) via a sigmoid Emax function, with a virtual first-order elimination rate (MTT) of 137 h for the drug exposure. The full model estimates a maximum inhibition (Emax) of 63.3% and an EC50 of 32.8 g, while the elimination rate constant for serum K+ (Kout) is 0.548 1/h.

## Biomarker turnover model

This page models **serum potassium** as an endogenous turnover response, separately from the drug's pharmacokinetics.

- **driver tier:** `none`
- **turnover quantities linked:** loss_rate
- **effect blocks:** 1
  - sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (virtual exposure): indirect_response_i on production; linked values: concentration_50, effect_max
- **turnover review:** <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span>
  - `B4_steady_state` — skipped: production and loss/clearance parameters are incomplete
  - `B4_effect_1` — skipped: the perturbing compound has no resolved concentration source
  - `B4_driver_link` — skipped: no driver PK source is available
