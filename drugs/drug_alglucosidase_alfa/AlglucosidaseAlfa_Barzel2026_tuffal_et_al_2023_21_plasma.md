**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The alglucosidase alfa record was rejected for a dimension mismatch on a structural parameter: the intercompartmental clearance Qpc is reported as 0.0157 L/h, which is the value of the rate constant k21 (0.0157 d−1), and total clearance CL has no value at all.**

In the two-compartment structure, k21 is 0.0157 d−1, and the same number 0.0157 appears again as Qpc in L/h, a unit that could not be converted to SI, so the mismatch could not be resolved. The clearance parameter CL is listed without any value. A second reader also disagreed on the dose compound and primary analyte (both recorded as alglucosidase alfa but flagged as unknown) and on the identity and value of the Q/Q2 parameter (0.254 L/h versus no value). Extracted — alglucosidase alfa: V1 3.37 L, Q2 0.254 L/h, V2 296 L, k21 0.0157 d−1, Vmax 12 mg/h, Km 0.541 µg/mL, Q3 1.87 L/h, V3 1.31 L, … (+1).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the links between molecules: this record has none, the second reading none → none (none); it also differs on 16 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'tuffal et al., 2023 [21]plasma' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Fixed effect parameters' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Barzel_2026_table_3:row0:col5'])
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Vm (mg/h)' → Q66 (unit '[mass] / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Inter-individual variability (CV%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Barzel_2026_table_3:row23:col5'])
- dropped duplicate Q63 ('VcV1', value '13.6') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q66 ('Vm', value '35.4') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q1 ('Km', value '52.4') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Qpc' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Barzel_2026_table_3:row34:col5'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=alglucosidase_alfa
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- structure disagreement: deterministic 2C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count
- bound model equation to Q22 (CL): CL = 1.97 * (TBW/20)^0.587Q = 0.931 * (TBW/20)^0.587Vc =1.52 * (TBW/20)^0.483Vp = 3.11 * (TBW/20)^0.483
- Q22 (CL) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'CL'; equation kept verbatim
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'tuffal et al., 2023 [21]plasma' subgroup of Barzel_2026 (paper reports 5 populations: gras-colomer et al., 2021 [25]plasma/leukocyteθ, qi et al., 2018 [23]plasma, tiraboschi et al., 2023 [22]plasma, troy et al., 2020 [26]serum/csf*, tuffal et al., 2023 [21]plasma)
- molar mass: none found for 'alglucosidase_alfa' — its concentrations stay mass-only
