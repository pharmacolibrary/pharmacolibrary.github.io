**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for alglucosidase alfa's bioavailability, clearance and absorption lag time.**

The model was built, but alglucosidase alfa's bioavailability, clearance and absorption lag time had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. Extracted — alglucosidase alfa: V 69.1 L, ktr 0.581 h−1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the links between molecules: this record has none, the second reading none → none (none); it also differs on 16 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `model_quarantined` (reviewed 2026-09-28 14:35:53.833100+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-05 10:36:33.622019+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'tiraboschi et al., 2023 [22]plasma' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Fixed effect parameters' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Barzel_2026_table_3:row0:col6'])
- relinked 'Ktrans (h−1)' Q338 → Q306 — same-named PK parameter preferred over the PD code in a popPK record
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Inter-individual variability (CV%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Barzel_2026_table_3:row23:col6'])
- dropped duplicate Q63 ('VcV1', value '40.3') — already have one for this compound
- relinked 'Ktrans' Q338 → Q306 — same-named PK parameter preferred over the PD code in a popPK record
- dropped duplicate Q306 ('Ktrans', value '42.0') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=alglucosidase_alfa
- bound model equation to Q22 (CL): CL = 1.97 * (TBW/20)^0.587Q = 0.931 * (TBW/20)^0.587Vc =1.52 * (TBW/20)^0.483Vp = 3.11 * (TBW/20)^0.483
- Q22 (CL) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'CL'; equation kept verbatim
- 1C volume normalization: Q63→Q61 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'Vc/V1 (L)' is the general volume)
- population split: 'tiraboschi et al., 2023 [22]plasma' subgroup of Barzel_2026 (paper reports 5 populations: gras-colomer et al., 2021 [25]plasma/leukocyteθ, qi et al., 2018 [23]plasma, tiraboschi et al., 2023 [22]plasma, troy et al., 2020 [26]serum/csf*, tuffal et al., 2023 [21]plasma)
- molar mass: none found for 'alglucosidase_alfa' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
