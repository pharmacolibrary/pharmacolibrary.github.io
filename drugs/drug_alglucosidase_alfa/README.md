<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| PD | Uddin_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies natural compounds from a plant and does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response data for the drug alglucosidase alfa. |
| PD | Ullman_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper evaluates a novel Glycogen Synthase 1 Inhibitor, not alglucosidase alfa. |
| PGx | Usenko_2023 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates lysosomal enzyme activities and gene variants in schizophrenia patients, not the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the drug alglucosidase_alfa. |
| popPK | Yue_2019 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of substrate reduction therapy for inborn errors of metabolism and does not report pharmacokinetic parameters for alglucosidase alfa. |
| PD | Yue_2019 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The text is a general review of substrate reduction therapy for inborn errors of metabolism and does not contain any specific data, analysis, or parameters for alglucosidase alfa. |
| PGx | de_2017 | not_relevant | 2 | 5 | The paper reports an association between GAA genotype and antibody formation (immunogenicity), but does not report a direct pharmacogenomic effect on a PK or PD parameter of alglucosidase_alfa. |
| popPK | van_2018 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical efficacy study reporting functional outcomes (FVC, muscle strength) rather than pharmacokinetic parameters for alglucosidase alfa. |
