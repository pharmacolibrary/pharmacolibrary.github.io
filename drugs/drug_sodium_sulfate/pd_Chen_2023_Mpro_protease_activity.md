<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Unknown drives name (in unknown) (inhibition; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> The paper reports in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease activity by screened natural-product compounds (including cholesteryl sodium sulfate), with inhibition rates measured at a single 80 μM screening dose and IC50 values derived by nonlinear regression of concentration–inhibition curves over a nM–mM range; the mechanism is direct inhibition of Mpro enzymatic activity (not an in vivo PD model), and no Imax, IC50, EC50, Emax, kin, kout, ke0 or gamma values specific to sodium sulfate are stated in the excerpts.

- **paper:** `Chen_2023`
- **model family:** `unknown`
- **driver:** `not_resolved`

Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.
