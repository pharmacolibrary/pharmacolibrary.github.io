<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PGx | Ghosal_2011 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the biotransformation of boceprevir, and phenolphthalein is only mentioned as an inhibitor used to characterize the enzyme AKR1C2, not as the drug of interest for pharmacogenomic analysis. |
| popPK | Lewis_2007 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the structural domains of UGT enzymes and substrate selectivity, not on the pharmacokinetic parameters of phenolphthalein. |
| PD | Lewis_2007 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the structural and functional characterization of UGT enzymes (substrate selectivity and autoactivation) and does not report pharmacodynamic or exposure-response relationships for phenolphthalein. |
| PGx | Lewis_2007 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the structural domains of UGT enzymes and their substrate selectivity/autoactivation, not on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of phenolphthalein. |
| popPK | Rao_1976 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro enzymatic study of estrone glucuronyltransferase where phenolphthalein is only mentioned as a non-competitive inhibitor, not as the subject of a pharmacokinetic analysis. |
| PD | Rao_1976 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the enzyme kinetics of estrone glucuronyltransferase and mentions phenolphthalein only as a noncompetitive inhibitor without providing specific numeric PD parameters (e.g., Ki, IC50) or an exposure-response relationship for phenolphthalein. |
| popPK | Rosemond_2004 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the enzymology of S-1360 metabolism, using phenolphthalein only as a chemical inhibitor to identify enzyme families, not as a subject drug for PK parameter estimation. |
| PD | Rosemond_2004 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports in vitro enzymology and inhibition kinetics for S-1360 metabolism; phenolphthalein is used only as a chemical inhibitor to identify the enzyme family, not as a drug with a pharmacodynamic exposure-response relationship. |
| PGx | Uesawa_2007 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the metabolism of dulcin and does not report pharmacogenomic effects on the PK or PD parameters of phenolphthalein. |
