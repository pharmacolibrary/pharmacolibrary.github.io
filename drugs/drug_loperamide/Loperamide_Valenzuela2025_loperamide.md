**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The loperamide parent–metabolite model was rejected because the peripheral volume V2/F (1770 L) was never emitted or defaulted, the output was set to the parent central compartment instead of the measured analyte, and the structure was reduced to a one-compartment enteral model rather than the declared parent–metabolite structure.**

The record declares a parent–metabolite structure with loperamide metabolized to N-desmethyl loperamide, but the built model used a single-compartment enteral structure, so the metabolite link and the two-compartment distribution (V1/F 3380 L, V2/F 1770 L, Q/F 219 L/h) were not represented; of six expected parameters only five were covered, with V2/F missing. The model output pointed at the parent's central compartment rather than the measured analyte compartment. The builder also assumed apparent parameterization (F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction), which was judged not acceptable, and a second reader disputed the primary analyte and the metabolite naming in the links. Extracted — loperamide: CL/F 293 L/h, V1/F 3.38e+03 L, V2/F 1.77e+03 L, Q/F 219 L/h, Frel 1, kabs 1.19 h−1, tlag 0.149 h, D1 0.551 h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which molecule was measured: this record has loperamide, the second reading M1; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q87 ('F 48 mg', value '1.20') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('k a 48 mg (h−1)', value '4.21') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q83 ('Alag 48 mg (h)', value '0.271') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=loperamide
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'loperamide' subgroup of Valenzuela_2025 (paper reports 2 populations: loperamide, m1)
- engineer: parent → metabolite not buildable on PK_3M_9C (None) — the measured compound's 1-compartment model instead
