A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** M1 (measured concentrations) drives placebo-adjusted change from baseline in Fridericia-corrected QT interval (in msec): delayed effect through an effect compartment.

**Model:** A model was generated (see the **Models** tab); it has no in-browser simulator.

> The model describes a linear, additive relationship where the concentration of the metabolite M1 in an effect compartment drives the placebo-adjusted change in QTcF (ΔΔQTcF) with a slope of 0.544 msec/ng·mL and an intercept of -1.66 msec. The delay between M1 concentration and the response is characterized by a ke0 of 0.094 h⁻¹ (corresponding to a delay of 10.6 h).

## Exposure-response model

`Loperamide_Valenzuela2025_PD_qtcf` — linear, `response = E0 + slope*exposure`

| parameter | value (paper units) | SI |
|---|---|---|
| E0 | -1.66 msec | -0.00166 s |
| slope | 0.544 msec/ng·mL | 544 meter ** 3 * second / kilogram |

Closed-form check points (response, SI): `at_0` = -0.00166, `per_exposure_unit` = 544

Deviations:

- `pd_binding_family_inferred` — the record's model family is effect_compartment; read from the parameters: a slope and no Emax — linear
- `pd_binding_off_target_driver` — driver compound 'M1' is not 'loperamide' nor one of its metabolites — the curve belongs to that compound's exposure (S12)

## Review

Verdict <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span> · route to `scholar`

| check | status | note |
|---|---|---|
| `T0_driver` | fail | off-target driver — the curve belongs to that compound |
| `T1_closed_form` | pass | engineer's check points reproduced from the bound parameters |
| `T1b_fmu` | skipped | template FMU / fmpy not available — advisory only |
| `T2_direction` | skipped | a line has no plateau to compare |
| `T3_plausibility` | fail | negative baseline -0.00166 for a response in msec |
| `T4_defaults` | pass | nothing defaulted |

Blocking:

- off_target_driver: 'M1' is not 'loperamide' (S12)
- T3 negative baseline -0.00166 for a response in msec
