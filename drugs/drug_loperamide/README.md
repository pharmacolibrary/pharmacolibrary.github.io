## About

**Description.** Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that is available as an over-the-counter product for treating diarrhea.[L42785] The drug was first synthesized in 1969 and used medically in 1976.[A251610] It is a highly lipophilic synthetic phenylpiperidine opioid that works by binding to mu-opioid receptors on intestinal muscles to decrease intestinal motility and electrolyte loss.[A251610] Loperamide has a chemical structure that is similar to diphenoxylate and haloperidol;[A6249] however, loperamide works on mu (μ)-opioid receptors to mediate its pharmacological actions.[A251610]

**Indication.** Loperamide is indicated for the relief of diarrhea, including Travelers’ Diarrhea.[L42785] As an off-label use, it is often used to manage chemotherapy-related diarrhea.[A251610]

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| PGx | Roseberry_2023 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper discusses loperamide only as a potential repurposed drug for anxiety based on biomarker targets, without reporting any pharmacogenomic effects on its pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters. |
| popPK | Ryu_2007 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the PET radioligand 18F-FCWAY, and loperamide is used only as a probe substrate to test P-gp inhibition, with no quantitative PK parameters reported for loperamide itself. |
| PGx | Schrickx_2014 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports in vitro P-gp inhibition by spinosad and lists loperamide as a reference substrate, but does not report any pharmacogenomic effect (gene variant) on loperamide's PK or PD. |
| popPK | Seneca_2009 | irrelevant | 2 | 1 | The study focuses on the PET radiotracer 11C-N-desmethyl-loperamide (a metabolite) for P-gp imaging and dosimetry, not the pharmacokinetic disposition parameters (CL, V, etc.) of the parent drug loperamide. |
| popPK | Sher_2022 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the pharmacological effects of a plant extract, using loperamide only as an agent to induce constipation in animal models, and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters for loperamide. |
| PD | Sher_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies the pharmacological effects of Chrozophora tinctoria extract, using loperamide only as a tool to induce constipation in the animal model, and does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response relationship for loperamide itself. |
| PGx | Simon_2021 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a case report on loperamide misuse and cardiotoxicity, containing no information on gene variants or pharmacogenomic effects on PK/PD parameters. |
| popPK | Storelli_2021 | irrelevant | 2 | 1 | The study focuses on in-vitro BBB permeability and brain-to-plasma ratio prediction for N-desmethyl loperamide (a metabolite), not systemic population pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, ka) for loperamide itself. |
| popPK | Tran_2005 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic analysis of P-gp transport kinetics in cell monolayers, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting disposition parameters (CL, V, etc.) for loperamide. |

| PD | Xu_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on a Markov model for diarrhea in breast cancer patients treated with lumretuzumab, pertuzumab, and paclitaxel, and does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response data for loperamide. |
| PGx | Zhou_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving CYP/P-gp inhibitors and does not report pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants) on loperamide PK/PD. |
