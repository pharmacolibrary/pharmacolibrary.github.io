## About

**Description.** Citalopram is an antidepressant belonging to the class of selective _serotonin-reuptake inhibitors_ (SSRIs) widely used to treat the symptoms of depression. It is a racemic bicyclic phthalate derivate and is the only compound with a tertiary amine and 2 nitrogen-containing metabolites among all SSRIs.[A261316,A14720] Citalopram enhances serotonergic transmission through the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, and among all the SSRIs, citalopram appears to be the most selective toward serotonin reuptake inhibition.[A261316,A14720] Specifically, it has a very minimal effect on dopamine and norepinephrine transportation and virtually no affinity for muscarinic, histaminergic, or GABAergic receptors.[A261316]

Citalopram was approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of depression in adults 18 years or older.[L5230]

**Indication.** Citalopram is approved by the FDA for treating adults with major depressive disorder.[L47941] It has also been used off-label to treat various diseases, including but not limited to sexual dysfunction, ethanol abuse, psychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and diabetic neuropathy.[L5224,A321,A322,A261296]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| popPK | Ahmed_2020 | irrelevant | not captured | not captured | The study focuses on acylcarnitine metabolomic profiles as biomarkers for depression phenotypes and does not measure or model any pharmacokinetic parameters for citalopram. |

| popPK | Bosch_2026 | irrelevant | not captured | not captured | The study reports only cross-sectional serum concentrations and metabolite ratios, lacking compartmental or population pharmacokinetic modeling and disposition parameters like clearance or volume of distribution. |
| popPK | Ho_2016 | irrelevant | not captured | not captured | The paper focuses on pharmacodynamic exposure-response modeling and uses pre-calculated AUC values from a previously published population PK model rather than reporting new citalopram disposition parameters. |
