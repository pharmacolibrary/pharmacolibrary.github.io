<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit inherited for V (Q61): 'L' from a same-Q-code sibling (this row's label had no unit)
- implicit units: 'α(CL) (%)' — the LLM proposed '%', whose dimension does not fit Q67; left unset
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q22 (CL(SCIT) (L/h)); Q61 (V(SCIT) (L)); Q61 (VMR)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=escitalopram (SCIT)
- template fit: PK_3M_9C — formed from central; parent 1, metabolites [1]
- population split: 'model for scit + sdcit in plasma + breast milk' subgroup of Weisskopf_2020 (paper reports 3 populations: estimate, model for scit + sdcit in plasma, model for scit + sdcit in plasma + breast milk)
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 13/13 row label(s) assigned, 22 linked by role; re-tagged parent→escitalopram (SCIT) ×34, parent→S-desmethylcitalopram (SDCIT) ×20
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
