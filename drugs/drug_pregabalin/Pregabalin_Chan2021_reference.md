**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**Only volume was extracted — no clearance; v/F, kabs and tlag have no unit.**

A model needs both clearance and volume; without the clearance it could only be built on a library default, so it was not. Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. Extracted — pregabalin: V/F 10.3, kabs 7.44, tlag 0.31.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of body_weight_on_cl_fd: this record has 0.48, the second reading none; it also differs on 10 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

**Model structure:** 1-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 3 extracted, plus 4 covariate effects.

**Parameterization:** V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.
