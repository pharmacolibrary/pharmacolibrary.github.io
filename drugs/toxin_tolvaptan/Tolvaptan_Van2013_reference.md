### Reviewer guidance

> ⚙️ **Pipeline limitation — scholar.** a reported unit is missing from the conversion table, so the parameter reached the engineer without an SI value<br><sub>evidence: `theta_cl_f_chf_nyha_class_1_or_2`, `theta_cl_f_chf_nyha_class_3_or_4`, `theta_cl_f_cirrhosis_child_pugh_score_ge_6_l_h`, `theta_cl_f_hyponatremia_moderate_hyponatremia`</sub>

> This is not a curation fix: the record is waiting on the pipeline, not on a reviewer's judgement.

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge; the engineer did not exercise the covariate scenarios this record defines. Evidence: T2_covariates_not_exercised.

**Steps:**
1. Not a curation fix — scholar limitation.
2. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.
3. Advisory only — the base model still replicates.
4. Check the record's covariate_definitions in _interpretv2.yaml.
5. Re-run the engineer for this drug if the covariate curves are wanted.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped value-less row: 'ω^2 for k_3'
- dropped value-less row: 'ω^2 for CL/F'
- dropped value-less row: 'ω^2 for V_c/F'
- dropped value-less row: 'ω^2 for CL_d/F'
- dropped value-less row: 'ω^2 for V_p/F'
- covariate effect for Q319 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- covariate effect for Q319 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- theta_v1_f_cirrhosis_child_pugh_score_ge_10_l: label says 'decrease' but the reported value is 71.9 (positive) — curated as an INCREASE, per the printed number
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=tolvaptan
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell Van_2013_table_p8_1:row16:col1 = '0.244 (49.4% CV)'
