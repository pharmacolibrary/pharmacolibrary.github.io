## About

**Description.** Desflurane, or I-653, a a volatile anesthetic that is more rapidly cleared and less metabolized than previous inhaled anesthetics such as [methoxyflurane], [sevoflurane], [enflurane], or [isoflurane].[A226390,A39015,A226893]. It was developed in the late 1980s out of a need for a more rapidly acting and rapidly cleared inhaled anesthetic.[A226883,A226888]

Desflurane was granted FDA approval on 18 September 1992.[L30285]

**Indication.** Desflurane is indicated for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia in adults, as well as the maintenance of anesthesia in pediatric patients.[L30285]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Kreuer_2008 | irrelevant | not captured | not captured | The study focuses exclusively on pharmacodynamic modeling of EEG responses to end-tidal concentrations and does not report systemic pharmacokinetic disposition parameters for desflurane. |
| popPK | Kreuer_2009 | irrelevant | not captured | not captured | The paper only reports pharmacodynamic effect-site equilibration (ke0) and dose-response parameters, lacking true pharmacokinetic disposition parameters like clearance or volume of distribution. |
| popPK | Ngamprasertwong_2016 | irrelevant | not captured | not captured | Desflurane is only co-administered as part of the anesthetic regimen, while the study exclusively reports population pharmacokinetic parameters for propofol. |
