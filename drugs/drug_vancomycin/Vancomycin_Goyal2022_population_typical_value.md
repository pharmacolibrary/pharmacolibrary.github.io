<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**Every check that could be run on this record passed.**

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has vancomycin, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `curated_candidate` (reviewed 2026-09-28 14:42:06.331189+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-04 18:41:53.669133+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'qCRCL' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Goyal_2022_table_S1:row1:col2'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=vancomycin
- population split: 'population typical value' subgroup of Goyal_2022 (paper reports 2 populations: final pk model, population typical value)

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell T2:row2:col3 = '31.9 [0.21]'
- unparsed cell T2:row7:col2 = '32.1 [0.21]'
- companion parameter table S1 transcribed (14 record(s), model stage 'base')
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2, S1
