# felbamate

- **generic name:** felbamate
- **ATC codes:** `N03AX10`
- **DrugBank:** [DB00949](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00949) · **PubChem:** [CID 3331](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3331)
- **molar mass:** 238.2399 g/mol (C11H14N2O4) — DrugBank

## About

**Description.** Felbamate is an anticonvulsant drug used in the treatment of epilepsy. In particular, in the adult patient population, it can be employed to treat partial seizures (with and without generalization). Alternatively, it is used to treat partial and generalized seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children. It has a weak inhibitory effect on GABA receptor binding sites.

**Indication.** For use only in those patients who respond inadequately to alternative treatments and whose epilepsy is so severe that a substantial risk of aplastic anemia and/or liver failure is deemed acceptable in light of the benefits conferred by its use.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
