## About

**Description.** The global prevalence of obesity is increasing rapidly. Obesity-related complications lead to significant personal and economic burden by reducing quality of life and increasing the cost of healthcare.  In some individuals, diet and exercise are insufficient to maintain weight loss, and pharmacological or surgical intervention is required.[A229928]

Orlistat is a lipase inhibitor used in the treatment of obesity that works by inhibiting fat-metabolizing enzymes. It was approved by the FDA for use in combination with a reduced-calorie diet in 1999.[L11130] This drug is a generally well-tolerated and effective weight-loss aid and is now available in both over-the-counter[L31963] and prescription preparations, depending on the dosage quantity.[L11130]

**Indication.** Orlistat is indicated for obesity management including weight loss and weight maintenance when used in combination with calorie reduction in overweight and obese adults; this indication applies to both the prescription formulation of 120 mg[L11130] and the over-the-counter formulation of 60 mg.[L31963] Orlistat in the 120 mg prescription formulation is also indicated to reduce the risk of weight regain following weight loss.[L11130]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| PD | Zhi_1995 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The paper mentions a qualitative correlation between blood glucose and glyburide concentration but does not provide numeric PD parameters (e.g., Emax, EC50) or a quantitative model for orlistat or the interaction. |
| popPK | Zouheira_2022 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro pharmacological investigation of plant extracts where orlistat is used only as a positive control for enzyme inhibition, with no pharmacokinetic parameters reported. |
| PD | Zouheira_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports in vitro enzyme inhibition IC50 values for plant extracts and orlistat, which are pharmacological potency metrics, not pharmacodynamic (exposure-response) parameters for the drug orlistat in a biological system. |
