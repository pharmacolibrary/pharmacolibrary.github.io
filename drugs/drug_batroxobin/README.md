## About

**Description.** Batroxobin is a defibrinogenating hemostatic agent derived from the venom of a pit viper, Bothrops atrox moojeni. In addition to batroxobin, the venom of Bothrops atrox has a composition of 10.2% neutral carbohydrate. Batroxobin is a serine protease, which cleaves the 16 Arginine - 17 Glycine bond in fibrinogen. The MW of batroxobin is approximately 43,000 g/mol-1, and it contains 231 amino acids.

Batroxobin is inactivated by alpha2-macroglobulin, but not anti-thrombin compounds.  Batroxobin will also bind fibrinogen in a manner different than thrombin and with a higher affinity. Once bound to fibrin, it will cause fibrin accretion(clot formation) to a degree 18 folds greater than thrombin. 

Currently use is experimental but trials have been conducted which support certain clinical applications. Recombinant Batroxobin in relatively affordable and could be accessed by mass production.

**Indication.** No approved indications. Batroxobin is a defibrongenating agent which has been observed to reduce fibrinogen levels and thus reduce clot risk when used intravenously.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
