- **ATC codes:** `A06AD18`, `A06AG07`, `B05CX02`, `V04CC01`
- **DrugBank:** [DB01638](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01638) · **PubChem:** [CID 5780](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5780)

## About

**Description.** A polyhydric alcohol with about half the sweetness of sucrose. Sorbitol occurs naturally and is also produced synthetically from glucose. It was formerly used as a diuretic and may still be used as a laxative and in irrigating solutions for some surgical procedures.

**Indication.** Used as a non-stimulant laxative via an oral suspension or enema.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
