## About

Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug used to treat and prevent malaria, and has also been used for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and amebiasis. It remains an approved medicine, including veterinary use, and is listed among WHO essential medicines, though resistance has limited its usefulness in some regions.

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Chairat_2018 | irrelevant | not captured | not captured | Chloroquine is only a co-administered comparator drug, and the paper exclusively reports population pharmacokinetic parameters for primaquine. |
| popPK | Commons_2019 | irrelevant | not captured | not captured | The paper is a clinical meta-analysis focusing on hemoglobin changes and hematological outcomes, with no pharmacokinetic data or modeling for chloroquine. |
| popPK | Daher_2019 | irrelevant | not captured | not captured | The study uses non-compartmental analysis to report only AUC and half-life, lacking population/compartmental modeling or key disposition parameters like clearance and volume of distribution. |
| popPK | Salman_2010 | irrelevant | not captured | not captured | The study exclusively models azithromycin pharmacokinetics, with chloroquine only co-administered and lacking any quantitative PK analysis. |
