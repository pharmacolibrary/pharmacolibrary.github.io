A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**No volume or clearance — not a compartmental population PK model.**

The paper reports no distribution volume and no clearance or elimination rate; it is an exposure/outcome paper.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has chloroquine, the second reading chloroquine and azithromycin; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped value-less row: 'first-order absorption rate constant'
- dropped value-less row: 'K a2'
- dropped value-less row: 'NA'
- dropped value-less row: 'OCC'
- dropped value-less row: 'V C /F'
- dropped value-less row: 'V P1 /F'
- dropped value-less row: 'V P2 /F'
- dropped value-less row: 'Q 1 /F'
- dropped value-less row: 'Q 2 /F'
- dropped value-less row: 'RSE'
- dropped value-less row: 'σ'
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number 80.8 (source ['tab_0:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=chloroquine
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
