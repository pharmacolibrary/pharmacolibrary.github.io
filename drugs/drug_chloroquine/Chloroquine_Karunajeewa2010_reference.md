A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The chloroquine parent–metabolite model was quarantined because chloroquine's clearance had no extracted value, so a library placeholder was used instead of the reported 15.2% metabolic clearance.**

The paper reports chloroquine's metabolic clearance to desethylchloroquine as 15.2% (a percentage, not an absolute clearance), and this unit could not be converted to SI, so the clearance parameter reached the model builder without a usable value and was left at a library default. The record also labels the relative bioavailability parameter with the verbatim label 'OFV' and the value 13462, which does not correspond to a bioavailability fraction. A second reader recorded no value for the 15.2% clearance and the 6707 L steady-state volume, and instead read a pregnancy effect on chloroquine clearance of 23, which this record lacks. The structure check also expected a parent–metabolite model with three compartments but the record describes a one-compartment structure. Extracted — chloroquine: Frel 1.35e+04, CL 15.2 %, V 6.71e+03 liters.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of cq metabolic clearance to decq (cl m ) accounts for: this record has 15.2, the second reading none; it also differs on 2 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- salvaged Q22 ('CQ metabolic clearance to DECQ (CL M ) accounts for'=15.2) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q61 ('median steady-state volume of distribution (V SS /F)'=6707) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=chloroquine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- unit re-normalised: V 'liters' now converts (value unchanged)
