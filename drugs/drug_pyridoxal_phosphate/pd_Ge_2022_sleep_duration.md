<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate drives name (in unknown) (inhibition; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> This cross-sectional (NHANES 2005–2010) study reports associations, not a pharmacodynamic model: serum pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) concentrations (quartiles, HPLC-measured) were negatively associated with the risk of very short (Q4 RRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43–0.81), short (Q4 RRR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61–0.83), and long (Q3 RRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34–0.94) sleep duration versus normal sleep (7–&lt;9 h), with a non-linear inverted U-shaped dose–response. No mechanism, potency (IC50/EC50/Emax), or rate parameters are given.

## Models

<p>No downloads: this record is <b>rejected</b>, so it is not published as a model. Any archives generated for it before the verdict have been removed — a download outlives the page that explains it.</p>

<div class="pk-tab-mark" data-tab="Simulation"></div>

_No web simulator for this record: its structure has no shared WebAssembly template. The FMI archive under **Models** carries its own compiled FMU._
