**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The tamoxifen-to-endoxifen metabolic clearance CL23/F has no value in the record (a second reader reads 0.459), and the absorption rate constant kabs (1.08) is reported without a usable unit, so the record was rejected.**

The link parameter CL23/F, the clearance for metabolism of tamoxifen to endoxifen, is absent from the extracted parameters, while a second reader assigns it the value 0.459. The absorption rate constant kabs (1.08) is reported with the unit 'unit', which could not be converted to SI, so a dimension mismatch on a structural parameter was flagged. The remaining parameters (tlag 0.442 h, V/F 912 L, CL/F 5.10 and 5.07 L/h, V1/F 400 L for endoxifen) are present with consistent units. Extracted — tamoxifen: kabs 1.08 unit, tlag 0.442 hour, V/F 912 L, CL/F 5.07 L/hour; endoxifen: CL/F 5.1 L/hour, V1/F 400 L.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of cl23/f: this record has none, the second reading 0.459. That field does not shape the model.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'k a (1/hour)' → Q49 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '1 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'CL20/F_Age a' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_3:row8:col2', 'tab_3:row8:col3'])
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('CL23/F (L/hour)', value '0.459') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'CL23/F_AS: 2.5-3 b' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_3:row21:col2', 'tab_3:row21:col3'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=endoxifen
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- template fit: PK_Parent_Metabolite — one metabolite formed from central, both 1-compartment
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles: per-genotype parameters — typical value from the reference group: CL23/F_AS: 2.5-3 b
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 19/19 row label(s) assigned, 9 linked by role; re-tagged parent→endoxifen ×8
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures 'endoxifen', not tamoxifen — the review values are the parent's

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell tab_3:row12:col1 = 'Apparent endoxifen formation for an AS of 2'
- unparsed cell tab_3:row24:col2 = '0.148 (39.9% CV)'
- unparsed cell tab_3:row26:col2 = '0.192 (46.0% CV)'
- unparsed cell tab_3:row28:col2 = '0.0295 (17.3% CV)'
- unparsed cell tab_3:row31:col2 = '0.037 (19.4% CV)'
