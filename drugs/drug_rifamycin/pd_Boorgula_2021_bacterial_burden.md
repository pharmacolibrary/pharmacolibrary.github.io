<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin (measured concentrations) drive name (in log10 CFU/mL): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> In HFS-MAC static-concentration studies, rifampin, rifapentine, and rifabutin concentrations (as AUC/MIC exposures) were related to MAC bacterial burden (log10 CFU/mL) via a three-parameter inhibitory sigmoid Emax model (Hill slope fixed at 1), a direct concentration-effect (kill) relationship with no effect-compartment or turnover component described. Potency was virtually identical across drugs: EC50 0.023 mg/L (rifampin), 0.070 mg/L (rifapentine), and 0.072 mg/L (rifabutin), with Emax of 5.674, 5.480, and 5.76 log10 CFU/mL, respectively; time-course fits by study day gave Emax values such as 2.07 (day 4) and 1.26 (day 21) log10 CFU/mL and EC50 values such as 6.65 (day 4) and 154.66 (day 7
