## About

**Description.** Tapentadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic with a dual mechanism of action. It is a mu-opioid receptor agonist that also inhibits norepinephrine reuptake.[A260721, A36596]

Tapentadol was first approved by the FDA on November 20, 2008. The extended-release formulation of tapentadol was also approved by the FDA on August 26, 2011.[L47291] Used in the management of pain, tapentadol is typically reserved for patients who have limited alternative treatment options.

**Indication.** Tapentadol is indicated for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Due to the risks of addiction, drug abuse, and drug misuse, tapentadol is reserved for patients for whom alternative treatment options are unavailable.[L47286, L47516, L47521]

The immediate-release tapentadol oral tablets are approved for use in patients six years and older with a body weight of at least 40 kg.[L47286] Tapentadol oral solution is used in patients aged six years and older with a body weight of at least 16 kg.[L47521] These formulations are not intended for long-term use unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic, for which alternative treatment options remain inadequate.

The extended-release tablets of tapentadol are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. They are also indicated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in adults severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. This formulation is not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic.[L47516]

One record per gene, so a paper reporting several genes appears on several rows.</td></tr><tr><td><code>affects</code></td><td>the PK or PD parameter the genotype SHIFTS, as an ontology Q-code plus its name — Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F (apparent clearance), Q32 = Cmax, Q88 = AUC, Q40 = Fab, Q321 = EC50, Q322 = IC50, Q305 = kfm. The record's per-phenotype theta is a multiplier ON that parameter: a poor-metaboliser theta shifts this value, it does not supply one. Two values are NOT parameters — Q100 (NIL) is an association or risk finding with no parameter target, and `safety` is an adverse-reaction risk such as an HLA allele. A PA… id instead of a Q-code marks a record derived from a ClinPGx/PharmGKB guideline lookup rather than read out of the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>mechanism</code></td><td>how the gene acts: metabolism, transport, target, formation, safety_allele, or unknown.</td></tr><tr><td><code>detail</code></td><td>the paper stem, linking to the full record page.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
