A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**Kel has no unit; the clearance plausibility check could not be computed.**

Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. The check had no reference to compare the clearance against, so the value is unverified rather than shown to be wrong. Extracted — tapentadol: CL 94.6 L/h, V 414 L, kabs 2.19 h−1, Fab 0.349, tlag 0.266 h, kel 0.122 wks −1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on bioavailability: this record has 0.349, the second reading 0.283; it also differs on 6 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `needs_review` (reviewed 2026-10-05 09:32:00.561531+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 05:41:35.831045+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Pop. Estimate' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['t0003:row1:col5'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'PMA50 (wks)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['t0003:row7:col4', 't0003:row7:col5', 't0003:row7:col6'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'wks −1' (kel)
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('Cov CL-V', value '0.031') — already have one for this compound
- covariate effect for Q325 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- covariate effect for Q319 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- implicit units: 'k (wks −1)' → 1/week (from the paper text: "The parameter string provided in the input is 'k (wks −1) = 0.013', which explicitly states the unit as 'wks −1' (invers")
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=tapentadol
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- model-stage split: 'final model with estimated exponents' is the final model of Khalil_2020 (paper reports 2 stages: final model with estimated exponents, final model with fixed exponents); same population, different model-building step
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell t0003:row12:col2 = '21.1(15.9% shrinkage)'
- unparsed cell t0003:row12:col5 = '20(16.9% shrinkage)'
- unparsed cell t0003:row13:col2 = '30.5(22.4% shrinkage)'
