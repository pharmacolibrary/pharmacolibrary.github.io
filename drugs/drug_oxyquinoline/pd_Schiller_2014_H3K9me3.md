The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** N-octyl ester of IOX1 (measured concentrations) drives H3K9me3 levels (in unknown) (inhibition; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> The n-octyl ester of IOX1 (compound 5) inhibits JmjC histone lysine demethylases, causing a dose-dependent increase in H3K9me3 levels in HeLa cells (cellular EC50 = 3.8 μm for H3K9me3 demethylation inhibition; in vitro IC50 against KDM4C = 3.9 μm, with other enzymes ranging from 6.3 μm for KDM4E to 45.0 μm for KDM4E ester and 16.3–34.9 μm for KDM2A/KDM3A/KDM5C). The mechanism is direct inhibition of 2OG-dependent demethylase activity (likely by the intact ester form, which is not efficiently hydrolysed in cells); no kinetic PD model parameters (Imax, kin, kout, ke0, gamma) are reported.

Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.
