<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives (measured concentrations) drives antifungal activity (in mM) (inhibition; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Concentrations of 8-hydroxyquinoline (HQ) derivatives (compounds 2, 4a–4o, 5b–5o) were related to inhibition of mycelial growth of phytopathogenic fungi (e.g. B. cinerea, S. sclerotiorum), reported as EC50 values in mM; the paper does not state a pharmacodynamic mechanism or model. Potency ranged from EC50 = 0.0021 mM (compound 2, B. cinerea) to 0.0827 mM (4a), with HQ itself at EC50 = 0.0331 mM and azoxystrobin at 0.3551 mM against B. cinerea.
