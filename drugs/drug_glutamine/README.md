# glutamine

- **generic name:** glutamine
- **ATC codes:** `A16AA03`
- **DrugBank:** [DB00130](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00130) · **PubChem:** not captured
- **groups:** approved, investigational, nutraceutical

## About

**Description.** A non-essential amino acid present abundantly throughout the body and is involved in many metabolic processes. It is synthesized from glutamic acid and ammonia. It is the principal carrier of nitrogen in the body and is an important energy source for many cells. An oral formulation of L-glutamine was approved by the FDA in July 2017 for use in sickle cell disease [L892]. This oral formulation is marketed under the tradename Endari by Emmaus Medical.

**Indication.** Used for nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalance.

Used to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older [FDA Label].

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
