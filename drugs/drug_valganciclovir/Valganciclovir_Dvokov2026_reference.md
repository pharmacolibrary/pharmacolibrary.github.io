The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="valganciclovir" model-id="Valganciclovir_Dvokov2026_reference" status="rejected" stale="false" population="lung transplant recipients" measured-compound="ganciclovir" parameterization="apparent" topology="general_linear"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** general linear; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 7 extracted, plus 1 covariate effect.

**Parameterization:** CLm/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label (paper)</code></td><td>the row or statistic label exactly as printed in the paper (label_verbatim) — never normalised, so it can be found in the PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Q-code · name</code></td><td>the ontology parameter this label was matched to (Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F, Q49 = ka, Q57 = half-life, …) and its canonical name. The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'CL' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (variance)')
- table section iiv: 'V1' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (variance)')
- table section iiv: 'F' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (variance)')
- column 'final model (rse %)' classified 'rse' by the LLM but kept as the estimate: the header names the point value
- kept covariate coefficient θeGFR=4.96 (covariate eGFR) — not an ontology parameter
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'kA, L/h' → Q49 (unit '[length] ** 3 / [time]' vs ontology '1 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped value-less row: 'RSE'
- dropped value-less row: 'CI'
- dropped value-less row: 'V1'
- dropped value-less row: 'CL'
- dropped value-less row: 'eGFR'
- dropped value-less row: 'V2'
- dropped value-less row: 'kA'
- dropped value-less row: 'Q'
- dropped value-less row: 'Tlag'
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['T3:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- implicit units: 'CLp' → L/h (from the paper text: "The paper states for clearance: 'For every 1 mL/min/1.73 m2 decrease in eGFR, there was a 0.06 L/h decrease in GCV/VGCV ")
- metabolite ganciclovir: Q22→Q351 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=ganciclovir
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: 1 first-order transfer(s) across 2 compounds → general_linear
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 21/21 row label(s) assigned, 7 linked by role; re-tagged parent→ganciclovir ×9, ganciclovir→parent ×3
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures 'ganciclovir', not valganciclovir — the review values are the parent's
