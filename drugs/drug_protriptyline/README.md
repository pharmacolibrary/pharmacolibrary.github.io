## About

Protriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant used to treat depression, including neurotic disorders. It is an approved medicine, though it is not widely used today and is mainly reserved for cases where other antidepressants are unsuitable.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
