## About

**Description.** A reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) selective for isoform A (RIMA) used to treat major depressive disorder. Most meta-analyses and most studies indicate that in the acute management of depression, moclobemide is more efficacious than placebo medication and similarly efficacious as tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  Due to negligible anticholinergic and antihistaminic actions, moclobemide has been better tolerated than tri- or heterocyclic antidepressants [A31901].

**Indication.** For the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder [A31901].

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| popPK | Cooper_2023 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a toxicology cohort analysis where moclobemide is a co-ingested comparator, and no pharmacokinetic parameters are reported. |

| PD | Dingemanse_1996_2 | not_relevant | 3 | 2 | The study reports qualitative PD interactions and changes in biomarkers (DHPG, serotonin) but does not provide numeric PD parameters (Emax, EC50) or a quantitative concentration-effect model. |
| popPK | Fox_2010 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan, with moclobemide serving only as a co-administered MAO-A inhibitor to assess interaction effects, not as the subject drug. |
