## About

**Description.** Ticagrelor, or AZD6140, was first described in the literature in 2003.[A204170,A2903] Ticagrelor is an ADP derivative developed for its P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonism.[A2903] Unlike [clopidogrel], ticagrelor is not a prodrug.[A2903] It is marketed by Astra Zeneca as Brilinta in the US[L14201] and Brilique or Possia in the EU,[L14207].

Ticagrelor was granted EMA approval on 3 December 2010.[L14207]
Ticagrelor was granted FDA approval on 20 July 2011.[L14201]

**Indication.** Ticagrelor is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome or a history of myocardial infarction.[L14201] Ticagrelor is also indicated to reduce the risk of a first myocardial infarction or stroke in high risk patients with coronary artery disease.[L14201]

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
