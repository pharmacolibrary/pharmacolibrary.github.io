<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Ticagrelor (concentrations from this paper's PK model) drives P2Y12 reaction units (in PRU): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

> Ticagrelor plasma concentration (nmol l–1) drives inhibition of PRU via a direct sigmoid Emax model (Emax 98.5%, EC50 116 nmol l–1, γ 1.59); the paper does not state an indirect/turnover mechanism, and using the sum of ticagrelor plus AR-C124910XX as driver was not significantly better than ticagrelor alone.

## Exposure-response model

`Ticagrelor_strand2019_PD_pru` — sigmoid_emax, `response = E0 + Emax*frac`

| parameter | value (paper units) | SI |
|---|---|---|
| E0 | 0 | — |
| Emax | -98.5 PRU | — |
| EC50 | 116 nmol l –1 | 0.000116 mol/m3 |
| gamma | 1.59 | — |

Closed-form check points (response, SI): `at_0` = 0, `at_EC50` = -49.25, `at_inf` = -98.5

Deviations:

- `defaulted_parameters` — E0
- `pd_binding_inhibition_sign` — effect_direction=inhibition with a positive Emax (Q320) — sign flipped

## Review

Verdict <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span> · route to `scholar`

| check | status | note |
|---|---|---|
| `T0_driver` | pass | driver is the drug, a synonym or one of its metabolites (or unnamed) |
| `T1_closed_form` | pass | engineer's check points reproduced from the bound parameters |
| `T1b_fmu` | fail | shared PD_SigmoidEmaxSweep FMU reproduces the reference points (worst 100.00%) |
| `T2_direction` | pass | curve direction matches effect_direction |
| `T3_plausibility` | pass | EC50, gamma, Imax and baseline in range |
| `T4_defaults` | fail | a core parameter took a library default: E0 |

Blocking:

- T1b the template FMU departs from the closed form by 100.0%

Advisory:

- defaulted: E0 — a row the paper has and the record lacks
