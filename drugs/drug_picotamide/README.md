## About

Picotamide is a platelet aggregation inhibitor, an antithrombotic drug used to prevent blood clots. It is not an approved medicine in the European Union and appears only as an experimental agent, so its current clinical use is unclear.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| PD | Liu_2021 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper reports IC50 values for novel compounds and compares them to picotamide, but does not provide numeric PD parameters (IC50, Emax, etc.) for picotamide itself, nor does it model a concentration-effect relationship for picotamide. |
| popPK | Vezza_1997 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic investigation of pharmacodynamic effects (vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation) and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| popPK | Wang_2019 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes the synthesis and in vitro anti-platelet activity of novel benzamides, not the pharmacokinetics of picotamide. |
