## About

Etoposide is a chemotherapy drug used to treat many cancers, including testicular cancer, lung small cell carcinoma, lymphomas, leukemias, and several other tumors. It is an approved medicine and appears on the WHO essential medicines list, so it is widely used in cancer care, though it carries a boxed warning.

The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Canal_1998 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is a review discussing general dose individualization strategies and mentions etoposide only in the context of dosage reduction for organ dysfunction, without reporting any quantitative pharmacokinetic parameter values. |
| popPK | Cheng_2024 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of trilaciclib, with etoposide serving only as a co-administered chemotherapy agent without reported PK parameters. |
| popPK | Friberg_2002 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The paper focuses on a pharmacodynamic model of myelosuppression rather than reporting quantitative pharmacokinetic disposition parameters (CL, V, etc.) for etoposide. |
| popPK | Kobayashi_1993 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is a review discussing pharmacodynamic models and therapeutic drug monitoring strategies, and it does not report original quantitative pharmacokinetic parameter values for etoposide. |
| popPK | Kobayashi_1994 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on pharmacodynamics and toxicity (myelosuppression, leukemia risk) rather than pharmacokinetic disposition parameters. |
| PD | Kobayashi_1994 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The text is a qualitative review/abstract that mentions a modified Hill equation model for myelosuppression but does not provide any numeric PD parameters, dose-response curves, or specific exposure-response data. |
| popPK | Li_2024 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of trilaciclib, with etoposide mentioned only as part of the chemotherapy regimen context. |
| popPK | Pigatto_2016 | relevant | 9 | 2 | The paper describes a population pharmacokinetic study of etoposide in rats, but the specific numeric parameter values (CL, V, Q) are not present in the provided evidence, only qualitative model descriptions and penetration percentages. |
| popPK | Reif_2002 | relevant | 10 | 0 | The title indicates a population pharmacokinetic study of etoposide, but no numeric parameter values are present in the provided evidence. |
| popPK | Toffoli_2004 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The text is a review discussing pharmacokinetic concepts and therapeutic thresholds (e.g., Cmax 3-5 mg/L) but does not report original quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, Q, ka) or population PK model estimates for etoposide. |
