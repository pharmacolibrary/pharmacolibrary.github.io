## About

**Description.** Argatroban is a direct, selective thrombin inhibitor. The American College of Cardiologists (ACC) recommend using bivalirudin or argatroban in patients who have had, or at risk for, heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Argatroban is a non-heparin anticoagulant shown to both normalize platelet count in patients with HIT and prevent the formation of thrombi. Parental anticoagulants must be stopped and a baseline activated partial thromboplastin time must be obtained prior to administering argatroban.

**Indication.** Argatroban is indicated for prevention and treatment of thrombosis caused by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). It is also indicated for use in patients with, or at risk for, HIT who are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| popPK | Chang_2016 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic assay measuring Hill coefficients and IC50 values, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting disposition parameters like clearance or volume. |
| PGx | Nowak_2009 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The text is a general overview of direct thrombin inhibitors and does not report any pharmacogenomic effects on argatroban's PK or PD parameters. |
| PGx | Scaglione_2013 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a general review of new oral anticoagulants and does not report any pharmacogenomic effects on argatroban. |
| popPK | Sivaraja_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the efficacy and mechanism of a new drug (VE-1902), using argatroban only as a comparator in in-vitro assays without reporting any pharmacokinetic parameters for argatroban. |
| PD | Sivaraja_2020 | not_relevant | 1 | 1 | The paper focuses on VE-1902 and only provides a single comparative EC50 value for argatroban in a thrombin generation assay, lacking a full dose-response curve or PK/PD model for argatroban. |
| PGx | Tran_1999 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study evaluates a drug-drug interaction (erythromycin) rather than a pharmacogenomic effect (gene variant/genotype) on argatroban PK/PD. |

| PGx | Wu_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on clopidogrel resistance and CYP2C19 genotypes; argatroban is only mentioned as a concomitant medication with a higher usage rate in the resistance group, with no pharmacogenomic analysis of argatroban PK/PD. |
