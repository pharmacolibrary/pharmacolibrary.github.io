<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Enalaprilat (measured concentrations) drives angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio (in unknown): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Enalaprilat (active metabolite of enalapril) concentrations inhibit the angiotensin II/angiotensin I ratio (a measure of ACE activity) via an Imax model with full inhibition — with a sigmoidicity factor in healthy adults and without in children with heart failure — and, due to a delay between enalaprilat concentration and effect in adults, an effect compartment was included (ke0 = 0.48). The IC50 was 30.01 µg/L (baseline ratio E0 = 0.043); the paper states the half-maximal inhibitory concentration was lower in children than in healthy adults but does not give the children's IC50 value in the excerpts.
