## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

## ADME sites

Where this drug is handled, from DrugBank's curated enzymes / transporters / carriers and the KB's PGx genes, mapped to tissue through the ADME gene table. Compare it with other drugs on the [Sites & interactions](sites?drugs=carteolol) page (add drugs there; the set becomes a link).

| process | tissue | actors (role) | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| metabolism | brain | `CYP2D6` substrate | DrugBank actor |
| metabolism | liver | `CYP2D6` substrate | DrugBank actor |

<sub>Actors without a tissue in the table: ADRB1 (partial agonist), ADRB1 (target), ADRB2 (target).</sub>

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Floreani_2004 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro pharmacological investigation of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and receptor binding, reporting no pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance, volume, or half-life. |
| popPK | Hester_1994 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro pharmacological investigation of vascular relaxing properties and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters for carteolol. |
| PGx | Ishii_2002 | not_relevant | 2 | 10 | The study compares pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters between two administration routes (ocular vs. nasal) in a single genotype group (extensive metabolizers), rather than comparing different genotypes to establish a pharmacogenomic effect. |
| PGx | Kudo_1997 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper identifies CYP2D6 as the enzyme metabolizing carteolol using cDNA-expressed systems but does not report pharmacogenomic effects of specific gene variants on PK/PD parameters. |
| PGx | Kudo_1998 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the metabolism of haloperidol and its interaction with CYP2D6 using carteolol as a probe substrate, but it does not report pharmacogenomic effects on the PK or PD parameters of carteolol itself. |
| PGx | Kudo_1999 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper discusses the pharmacokinetics of haloperidol and mentions carteolol only as a drug interaction partner, not as the subject of a pharmacogenomic study. |
| popPK | Kuwahara_2005 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic investigation of UVB protection and radical scavenging, reporting no pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| PGx | Umehara_1997 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates in vitro metabolism in rat liver microsomes and does not report pharmacogenomic effects of human gene variants on PK or PD parameters. |
| popPK | Zhao_1998 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | no_text gate: only 86 chars of text extracted (&lt; 400) |
| PD | Zhao_1998 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes the pharmacological mechanism (partial agonism) but does not report a quantitative exposure-response or dose-response analysis with numeric PD parameters. |
