<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Luseogliflozin (concentrations from the PK model of Samukawa_2017) drives urinary glucose excretion (in g/day): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Luseogliflozin (0.5–5 mg once daily) stimulates urinary glucose excretion (UGE, g/day) in Japanese patients with T2DM by inhibiting SGLT2; the paper does not state a mechanism beyond SGLT2 inhibition. A sigmoid Emax model related AUC to UGE, with Emax (maximum change in UGE) estimated at 119 g and EC50 defined as the AUC at 50% of UGE; the 5 mg dose gave a mean daily UGE of 101 g/day (~85% of Emax), but the paper does not report numeric EC50 or γ values.
