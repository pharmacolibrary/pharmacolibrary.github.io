## About

**Description.** Melphalan is a nitrogen mustard or bischloroethylamine type alkylating agent.[L40928] It was first synthesized in the early 1950s by substituting L-phenylalanine for the methyl group on nitrogen mustard.[A261150, A261155] Melphalan is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and ovarian carcinoma.[L40928] It is also used for high-conditioning before hematopoietic stem cell transplant.[L47890] It is also used to treat uveal melanoma with unresectable hepatic metastases.[L47895]

**Indication.** Melphalan is indicated for use as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma.[L47890] It is also indicated for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and for the palliation of non-resectable epithelial carcinoma of the ovary.[L40928]

Melphalan is a component of HEPZATO KIT, a liver-directed therapy indicated for the treatment of adults with uveal melanoma with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation.[L47895]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
