A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The meloxicam model record was rejected because the apparent-parameter coherence check found a double correction: the relative bioavailability Frel of 2.00 (labelled 'x 2 F') and the CL/F parameter were both applied, correcting clearance for bioavailability twice.**

The record contains meloxicam parameters CL = 0.390 L/h, V1 = 7.80 L, Q = 1.24 L/h, V2 = 2.72 L, kabs = 2.05 /h, and a relative bioavailability Frel = 2.00 labelled 'x 2 F', alongside a CL/F parameter (total clearance after oral administration adjusted for bioavailability). Applying the bioavailability factor both through Frel and through the CL/F parameter constitutes a double correction, violating apparent-parameter coherence, so the record was refused. The two readers disagreed only on how the 'x 2 F' bioavailability parameter should be classified, not on the rejection cause. Extracted — meloxicam: CL 0.39 L/h, V1 7.8 L, V 1.06, Q 1.24 L/h, V2 2.72 L, kabs 2.05 /h, Frel 2.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[x 2 f].parameter_id`: this record has Q87, the second reading Q80. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

**Parameterization:** CL/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('CYP2C9 *2 on CL', value '20.147') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('CYP2C9 *3 on CL', value '20.400') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: '/h' (kabs)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'DT (h)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row10:col1', 'tab_1:row10:col3'])
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('x Ka -x F', value '0.262') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=meloxicam
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- unit re-normalised: kabs '/h' now converts (value unchanged)
