## About

**Description.** Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve various types of pain, including pain caused by musculoskeletal conditions, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.[A190189] With a longer half-life than most other NSAIDS, it is a favorable option for those who require once-daily dosing. Meloxicam is available in oral, transdermal, and intravenous formulations. It is a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, purportedly reducing the risk of adverse gastrointestinal tract effects, however, this is a topic of controversy.[A190198,A190201]

**Indication.** Meloxicam on its own is indicated for:

- the symptomatic treatment of arthritis and osteoarthritis. [L11398]
- the pauciarticular and polyarticular course of Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) in patients aged 2 years old or above. [L11398]
- the management of moderate-to-severe pain, alone or in combination with non-NSAID analgesics. [L53323]

Meloxicam, in combination with [bupivacaine], is indicated for postsurgical analgesia in adult patients for up to 72 hours following soft tissue surgical procedures, foot and ankle procedures, and other orthopedic procedures in which direct exposure to articular cartilage is avoided.[L50427]

Meloxicam, in combination with [Rizatriptan] is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.[L52405]

Off-label uses include the treatment of dental or post-surgical pain.

<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
