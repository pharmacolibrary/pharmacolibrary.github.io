# saccharated iron oxide

- **generic name:** saccharated iron oxide
- **ATC codes:** `B03AB02`
- **DrugBank:** [DB09146](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09146) · **PubChem:** not captured
- **groups:** approved, investigational

## About

**Description.** Iron sucrose (sucroferric oxyhydroxide or iron saccharate) is used as a source of iron in patients with iron deficiency anemia with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those who are undergoing dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal) and those who do not require dialysis. Due to less side effects than iron dextran, iron sucrose is more preferred in chronic kidney disease patients.

**Indication.** Iron sucrose is elemental iron as an injection. It replenishes body iron stores in patients with iron deficiency.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
