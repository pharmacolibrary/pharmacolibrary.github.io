A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The emicizumab model was quarantined because its clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and lag time had no values in the source, so placeholder numbers were substituted.**

The record lists CL/F 28.7, V/F 25.9 and KA 72.5 for emicizumab, but the model builder left clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time without extracted values, so library placeholder numbers stood in for them. The absorption rate constant was invented by defaulting, which the adjudication marked as not acceptable. The model also assumes bioavailability F=1 and Fm=1 with no molar correction, i.e. an apparent parameterization. Extracted — emicizumab: CL/F 28.7, V/F 25.9, kabs 72.5.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has emicizumab, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 7 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'CL/F' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-individual variabilitya')
- table section iiv: 'V/F' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-individual variabilitya')
- table section iiv: 'KA' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-individual variabilitya')
- table section iiv: 'Correlation CL/F–V/F' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-individual variabilitya')
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Fixed effects (BW 70 kg; ALB 45 g/L; age &lt; 30 years)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab4:row1:col2'])
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('Effect of BW on CL/F', value '0.911') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q76 ('Effect of BW on V/F', value '1.00') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Condition numbere' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab4:row20:col2'])
- implicit units: 'CL/F' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'The paper does not explicitly state the unit for CL/F in the provided text or table captions. However, CL/F is an appare')
- implicit units: 'V/F' → L (from the popPK convention: 'The paper does not explicitly state the unit for V/F in the provided text or table captions. V/F is an apparent volume o')
- implicit units: 'KA' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'The paper does not explicitly state the unit for KA in the provided text or table captions. KA is a first-order absorpti')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=emicizumab
- population split: 'estimate' subgroup of Retout_2020 (paper reports 4 populations: 1.5 mg/kg qw, 3 mg/kg q2w, 6 mg/kg q4w, estimate)
- molar mass: none found for 'emicizumab' — its concentrations stay mass-only

<p><b>FMI is two downloads.</b> The archive holds this record's parameters and its driver; the simulator itself is <code>PK_1C_enteral.fmu</code>, one compiled template shared by every model of this structure. Take the FMU once, keep it beside the script (or pass <code>--fmu PATH</code>). Running it reproduces the model-specific FMU exactly.</p>

<sub>Runs this record's model in the browser as WebAssembly. Sliders start at the extracted values; the reference check compares the browser's peak against the FMPy result recorded when the record was built, and is withheld once a value has been edited. Template `PK_1C_enteral` · parameters `Emicizumab_Retout2020_estimate_params.json` · controls `Emicizumab_Retout2020_estimate_sim_controls.json`. A slider marked *simulator value* is running on the template's own default because this record does not pin that parameter.</sub>
