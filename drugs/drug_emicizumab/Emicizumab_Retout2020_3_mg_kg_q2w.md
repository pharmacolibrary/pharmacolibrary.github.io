A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The emicizumab record was quarantined because clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time were not reported in the paper, so library placeholder values stood in for these parameters.**

The paper (Retout_2020, adult and pediatric hemophilia A) reports only summary exposure metrics for emicizumab — terminal half-life 26.8 days, Cmax,SS 58.1 μg/mL, tmax,SS 3.76 days, Ctrough,SS 46.7 μg/mL, AUCSS 749 μg·day/mL and Cavg,SS 53.5 μg/mL — plus between-patient variability figures (56.4% on CL/F, 60.7% on V/F), but no structural clearance, volume, ka or Tlag values. The model builder substituted placeholder values for these four parameters and assumed an apparent parameterization (F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction) with first-order depot input; the invented absorption default was judged not acceptable. A second reader disagreed on the parameterization (mechanistic vs apparent) and on whether the BPV entries and Cmax,SS/Ctrough,SS (1.26) and t1/2,abs (1.61) belong in the record. One reported unit could not be converted to SI, so that parameter reached the build without an SI value. Extracted — emicizumab: t1/2z 26.8 day, Cmax 58.1 μg/mL, tmax 3.76 day, Ctrough 46.7 μg/mL, AUCSS 749 μg × day/mL, Cavg 53.5 μg/mL, CL/F 56.4 %, V/F 60.7 %.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on how the model is parameterised: this record has apparent, the second reading mechanistic; it also differs on 4 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('t1/2,abs (day)', value '1.61') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Cmax,SS/Ctrough,SS (–)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Retout_2020_table_5:row6:col3'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'μg × day/mL' (AUCSS)
- salvaged Q27 ('BPV on CL/F from 56.4 to 30.0%'=56.4) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q76 ('BPV on V/F from 60.7 to 28.1%'=60.7) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=emicizumab
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: '3 mg/kg q2w' subgroup of Retout_2020 (paper reports 4 populations: 1.5 mg/kg qw, 3 mg/kg q2w, 6 mg/kg q4w, estimate)
