**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for protein c's clearance, volume of distribution and absorption lag time; the covariate scenarios were not simulated (+1 more).**

The model was built, but protein c's clearance, volume of distribution and absorption lag time had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. The base model was simulated, not the covariate effects the record defines. Extracted — protein c: CL 7.14 dL/h, V 60.7 dL, kabs 0.0379 1/h, Fab 0.79.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has protein C concentrate, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 2 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>the checker's own wording — not yet put into words by an LLM</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `protein C concentrate`, measured `protein C`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped PD-category row 'Rate of endogenous protein C production (IU/h)' → Q327 (kin, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['TB25050017-3:row4:col1'])
- covariate level 'Effect of age on the rate of endogenous protein C production' → Q900:effect_of_age_on_the_rate_of_endogenous_protein_c_production = 0.589 (linear_fractional on Q22)
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('Effect of SCPCD indication on clearance', value '-0.575') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Effect of SCPCD indication on rate of endogenous protein C production' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['TB25050017-3:row9:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Duration of administration (h) b' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['TB25050017-3:row15:col1', 'TB25050017-3:row15:col2', 'TB25050017-3:row15:col3'])
- implicit units: 'First-order absorption rate constant (1/h)' → 1/h (from the paper text: 'The paper text explicitly states: "the first-order absorption rate constant was estimated as 0.0379 1/h".')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=protein C
- molar mass: none found for 'protein_c' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- molar mass: none found for 'protein C' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
