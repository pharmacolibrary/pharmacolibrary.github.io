## About

**Description.** Repaglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to β cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Repaglinide induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Repaglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile. Repaglinide metabolites do not possess appreciable hypoglycemic activity. Approximately 90% of a single orally administered dose is eliminated in feces and 8% in urine.

**Indication.** As an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| PGx | Stenglein_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports a drug-drug interaction (zapnometinib affecting repaglinide PK) but does not report any pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants/genotypes) on PK or PD parameters. |
| PGx | Topletz-Erickson_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study evaluates drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with tucatinib, not pharmacogenomic effects of gene variants on repaglinide PK/PD. |
| PGx | Türk_2020 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on a PBPK model for trimethoprim and its interactions, not on the pharmacogenomics of repaglinide itself. |
| PGx | Varma_2013 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on mechanistic modeling of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving inhibitors, not on pharmacogenomic effects of genetic variants on repaglinide PK/PD. |
| PGx | Wang_2015 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of drug-drug interactions involving clopidogrel and does not report pharmacogenomic effects on repaglinide PK/PD parameters. |
| popPK | Wängler_2004 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes the synthesis and in vitro binding/functional evaluation of a radiolabeled analog for PET imaging, not a pharmacokinetic study of repaglinide. |
| popPK | Wängler_2004_2 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The paper focuses on the synthesis and PET imaging properties of a radiolabeled derivative of repaglinide, reporting biodistribution percentages and binding affinity (Kd) rather than standard pharmacokinetic disposition parameters (CL, V, ka) for the parent drug. |
| PGx | Xiao_2015 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates drug-drug interaction (repaglinide inhibiting pioglitazone) and does not report any pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants) on PK/PD parameters. |
| PGx | Yılmaz_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper discusses the diagnosis of MODY using HbA1c and GCK variants, but does not mention repaglinide or any pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters of the drug. |
| PGx | Zhang_2006 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports pharmacogenomic effects on nateglinide, not repaglinide. |
