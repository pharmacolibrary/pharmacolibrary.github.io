<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="sultiame" model-id="Sultiame_Dao2020_reference" status="needs_review" stale="false" population="healthy volunteers" measured-compound="sultiame" parameterization="mechanistic" topology="2C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 2-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 7 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'h−1·µM−1' (kon)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'QRen (%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['prp2558-tbl-0002:row9:col1', 'prp2558-tbl-0002:row9:col2', 'prp2558-tbl-0002:row9:col3', 'prp2558-tbl-0002:row9:col4', 'prp2558-tbl-0002:row9:col5', 'prp2558-tbl-0002:row9:col7'])
- dropped value-less row: 'Aa'
- dropped value-less row: 'Ap'
- dropped value-less row: 'Vc'
- dropped value-less row: 'Aery'
- dropped value-less row: 'Very'
- dropped value-less row: 'ka'
- dropped value-less row: 'ke'
- dropped value-less row: 'kon'
- dropped value-less row: 'koff'
- dropped value-less row: 'Bbound'
- dropped value-less row: 'Bfree'
- dropped value-less row: 'Btot'
- dropped value-less row: 'Qren'
- documentation only: 'Foral' → Q41 (FG) comes from ['prp2558-fig-0001:caption'], not from a located parameter table — not emitted as a model parameter
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q22 (CLplasma (L/h)); Q63 (Vc (L)); Q61 (Very (L))
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=sultiame
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
