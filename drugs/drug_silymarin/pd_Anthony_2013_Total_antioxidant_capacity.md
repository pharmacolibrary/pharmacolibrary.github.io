<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Taxifolin (measured concentrations) drives name (in uric acid equivalent) (inhibition; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Taxifolin (a purified silymarin component) was tested in vitro for antioxidant activity against total antioxidant capacity-type assays; the paper does not state a PD mechanism beyond direct radical scavenging, and no Imax, IC50, kin, kout or ke0 values are given. The key potency value reported is an EC50 of 32 µM for taxifolin in the DPPH free radical scavenging assay, the most potent of the components (others ranged 115–855 µM).

- **paper:** `Anthony_2013`
- **model family:** `unknown`
- **driver:** `conc_no_pk`
- **tier:** descriptive

<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>second reader</code></td><td>a model that re-read the paper independently, always from a different family than the first reading (scholarv2.secondary_for): a qwen primary is checked by gpt-oss:120b, a gpt-oss primary by qwen3.8:27b-mtp-q8_0 — two checkpoints of one family share their misreads, so agreement between them would mean little. A record can have several readers.</td></tr><tr><td><code>agreement</code></td><td>share of the compared fields that reader agreed on.</td></tr><tr><td><code>verdict</code></td><td>per reader: `confirmed` it agrees throughout · `partly confirmed` a non-structural field differs · `not confirmed` a structural one differs (clearance, a volume, ka, a lag) · `primary re-run` the first reading extracted nothing and was given one hinted retry.</td></tr><tr><td><code>combined</code></td><td>the record's verdict over ALL its readers: confirmed only when every reader that answered agrees, disputed as soon as one disagrees on a structural parameter. The most favourable reading is never taken — an extra reader must not be a way to find one that agrees.</td></tr><tr><td><code>kept</code></td><td>which reading the record holds. ALWAYS the first — a disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction, so the numbers on this page are the first model's either way.</td></tr></tbody></table>
