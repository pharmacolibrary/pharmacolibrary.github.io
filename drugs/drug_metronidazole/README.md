## About

**Description.** Metronidazole is a commonly used antibiotic, belonging to the nitroimidazole class of antibiotics.[L3754] It is frequently used to treat gastrointestinal infections as well as trichomoniasis and giardiasis, and amebiasis which are parasitic infections.[A181036,A181039] Metronidazole has been used as an antibiotic for several decades[L7429], with added antiparasitic properties that set it apart from many other antibacterial drugs, allowing it to treat a wide variety of infections. It is available in capsule form, tablet form, and topical form, and suppository preparations for the treatment of various infections.

**Indication.** Metronidazole is indicated for the treatment of confirmed trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis (except for in the first trimester of pregnancy) and the patient's sexual partners, bacterial vaginosis,[L7432, L49811] certain types of amebiasis, and various anaerobic infections.[A181057, L49811] The above anaerobic infections may occur on the skin and skin structures, the abdomen, the heart, reproductive organs, central nervous system, and the respiratory system. Some may also be present in the bloodstream in cases of septicemia. Common infections treated by metronidazole are Bacteroides species infections, Clostridium infections, and Fusobacterium infections, as well as Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus infections.[L3754] Topical formulations of metronidazole are indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea.[L45166]

It is also used off-label in the treatment of Crohn's disease, as a prophylactic agent after surgery[A181039], and in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.[A181045] It has also been studied in the prevention of preterm births and to treat periodontal disease.[A1391,A181078]

| PGx | Wang_2000 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates a drug-drug interaction (metronidazole affecting midazolam) and does not report any pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants) on the PK or PD of metronidazole. |
| PGx | Wang_2017 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the effect of metronidazole on CYP450 enzyme activity in rats exposed to high altitude, rather than the effect of a gene variant on metronidazole pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. |
| PGx | Wang_2020 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates bacterial gene mutations (H. pylori) causing antibiotic resistance, not human pharmacogenomics affecting drug PK/PD. |
| PGx | Yu_2021 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper discusses drug-drug interactions (DDI) involving enzymes and transporters, not pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants) on metronidazole PK/PD. |
| popPK | Zelenitsky_2016 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study is a PK-PD simulation using existing models to evaluate prophylaxis regimens, and it does not report original quantitative PK parameter values (CL, V, etc.) for metronidazole in the provided evidence. |
| PD | Zelenitsky_2016 | not_relevant | 4 | 2 | The study uses PK-PD modeling (target attainment) but reports only binary coverage percentages (e.g., 99% of subjects) rather than continuous numeric PD parameters like Emax, EC50, or dose-response curves for metronidazole. |
| PGx | Zemanová_2021 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the effect of gut microbiome presence (germ-free vs. specific-pathogen-free mice) on metronidazole metabolism, not the effect of a specific gene variant or genotype. |
| popPK | Zhanel_2013 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of ceftazidime-avibactam pharmacokinetics and does not report quantitative PK parameters for metronidazole, which is only mentioned as a potential combination therapy. |
| popPK | Zhanel_2014 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the pharmacokinetics of ceftolozane/tazobactam, and metronidazole is only mentioned as a comparator agent in clinical trials without any PK parameter reporting. |
