<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="amodiaquine" model-id="Amodiaquine_Ali2018_bsv_or_bova_b" status="needs_review" stale="false" population="pediatric and adult patients with uncomplicated malaria" measured-compound="desethylamodiaquine" parameterization="apparent" topology="parent_metabolite"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** parent + metabolite; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 1 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CLm/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

| label (paper) | Q-code · name | value | unit | value_si | unit_canonical | RSE% | link | source | covariates | IIV |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| clearance reached at least 95% of the adult values at approximately | `Q351` · CLm/F | 21 | L/h | 5.833333333333334e-06 | L/h | not captured | boundary (0.8) | Ali_2018:discussion_prose | — | not captured |

<details class="legend">
<summary>Column legend — what each column means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label (paper)</code></td><td>the row or statistic label exactly as printed in the paper (label_verbatim) — never normalised, so it can be found in the PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Q-code · name</code></td><td>the ontology parameter this label was matched to (Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F, Q49 = ka, Q57 = half-life, …) and its canonical name. The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'Ka (1/h)' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV or BOVa,b')
- table section iiv: 'MTT (h)' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV or BOVa,b')
- table section iiv: 'F' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV or BOVa,b')
- table section iiv: 'CLAQc (liters/h)' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV or BOVa,b')
- table section iiv: 'VcAQc (liters)' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV or BOVa,b')
- table section iiv: 'Additive errord (ng/ml)' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV or BOVa,b')
- table section iiv: 'CLDEAQc (liters/h)' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV or BOVa,b')
- table section iiv: 'VcDEAQc (liters)' routed out of structural estimates ('BSV or BOVa,b')
- salvaged Q22 ('clearance reached at least 95% of the adult values at approximately'=21) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- implicit units: 'clearance reached at least 95% of the adult values at approximately' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'No unit stated in the provided text or captions for clearance; allometric scaling on clearance parameters is described. ')
- metabolite desethylamodiaquine: Q22→Q351 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=desethylamodiaquine
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- population split: 'bsv or bova,b' subgroup of Ali_2018 (paper reports 2 populations: bsv or bova,b, typical valuea)
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 21/21 row label(s) assigned, 21 linked by role; re-tagged parent→desethylamodiaquine ×12, desethylamodiaquine→parent ×1
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
