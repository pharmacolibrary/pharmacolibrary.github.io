## About

**Description.** Treprostinil is a stable tricyclic analogue of prostacyclin[A248770] that promotes the vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds and the inhibition of platelet aggregation.[L41855,L41860,L41865] It reduces symptoms in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease.[L41855,L41860] The first agent approved for the treatment of PAH was [epoprostenol], a synthetic prostacyclin that significantly increases patients' quality of life. However, the use of epoprostenol is limited due to its short half-life (3-5 min) and instability at room temperature.[A248770,A248775] The use of more stable alternatives such as treprostinil provides patients with PAH with more treatment options.

Treprostinil was approved by the FDA in 2002 for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.[L41860] It is available in the following routes of administration: subcutaneous, intravenous, inhaled and oral. The first generic form of treprostinil became available in 2019.[A248775]

**Indication.** The FDA has indicated treprostinil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension[L41855,L41860,L41865] and pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease[L41855] to improve exercise ability. It is also used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients requiring transition from epoprostenol.[L41860] The Health Canada label specifies that treprostinil is indicated for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in NYHA Class III and IV patients who did not respond adequately to conventional therapy.[L24244]

<summary>What the PGx columns mean</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>gene</code></td><td>the gene whose variants the record is about. One record per gene, so a paper reporting several genes appears on several rows.</td></tr><tr><td><code>affects</code></td><td>the PK or PD parameter the genotype SHIFTS, as an ontology Q-code plus its name — Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F (apparent clearance), Q32 = Cmax, Q88 = AUC, Q40 = Fab, Q321 = EC50, Q322 = IC50, Q305 = kfm. The record's per-phenotype theta is a multiplier ON that parameter: a poor-metaboliser theta shifts this value, it does not supply one. Two values are NOT parameters — Q100 (NIL) is an association or risk finding with no parameter target, and `safety` is an adverse-reaction risk such as an HLA allele. A PA… id instead of a Q-code marks a record derived from a ClinPGx/PharmGKB guideline lookup rather than read out of the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>mechanism</code></td><td>how the gene acts: metabolism, transport, target, formation, safety_allele, or unknown.</td></tr><tr><td><code>detail</code></td><td>the paper stem, linking to the full record page.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
