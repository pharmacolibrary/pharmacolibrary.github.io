<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="isatuximab" model-id="Isatuximab_Brillac2025_model_1" status="rejected" stale="false" population="Pediatric patients with R/R acute leukemia pooled with adults from ISLAY" measured-compound="isatuximab" parameterization="mechanistic" topology="2C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 2-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 3 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'ω(CL)' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (%)')
- table section iiv: 'ω(V1)' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (%)')
- table section iiv: 'ω(Q)' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (%)')
- table section iiv: 'ω(V2)' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (%)')
- table section iiv: 'Residual error proportional (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (%)')
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): '−2LL' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab1:row1:col1', 'Tab1:row1:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'BIC' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab1:row2:col1', 'Tab1:row2:col2'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'WT/MedWT' (allometric_exponent)
- dropped duplicate Q319 ('β_V1_log(WT/MedWT)', value '1') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q319 ('β_Q_log(WT/MedWT)', value '0.85') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'WT/MedWT' (equation variable)
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number 54 (source ['Tab1:footnote', 'Tab1:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=isatuximab
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- bound model equation to Q22 (CL): CL = 0.00775 * (WT/54)^0.85(fixed)
- bound model equation to Q30 (Q): Q = 0.0386 * (WT/54)^0.85(fixed)
- Q22 (CL) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'CL (L/h)'; equation kept verbatim
- Q30 (Q) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'Q (L/h)'; equation kept verbatim
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'model 1 (n = 32)' subgroup of Brillac_2025 (paper reports 2 populations: final model with β coefficient on q fixed (n = 79), model 1 (n = 32))
- molar mass: none found for 'isatuximab' — its concentrations stay mass-only

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell Tab1:row5:col5 = '1.37E–08'
- unparsed cell Tab1:row7:col5 = '&lt; 2.2E–16'
- unparsed cell Tab1:row11:col5 = '7.08E–07'
- captured model equation CL = 0.00775 * (WT/54)^0.85(fixed)
- captured model equation Q = 0.0386 * (WT/54)^0.85(fixed)
