## About

**Description.** Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare blood clotting disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and various degrees of organ damage.[A262076] It may be inherited (congenital TTP; cTTP) or acquired due to autoantibodies (immune-mediated TTP; iTTP), although cTTP accounts for <5% of all cases of TTP.[A262076] Patients with cTTP have a severe deficiency of a plasma metalloproteinase called ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), which is responsible for cleaving large von Willebrand factor multimers and preventing the formation of microthrombi - this deficiency in ADAMTS13 is responsible for the microangiopathic complications associated with cTTP.[A262076] Standard therapy for cTTP involves prophylactic plasma infusions to supplement insufficient ADAMTS13 plasma levels.[A262071]

Apadamtase alfa, sold under the brand name Adzynma (ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn), was approved by the FDA in November 2023 for use as an enzyme replacement therapy in patients with cTTP.[L48756]

**Indication.** Recombinant human ADAMTS13 is indicated for prophylactic or on-demand enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in adult and pediatric patients with congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP).[L48746]

<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
