## About

Esomeprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor used for acid-related stomach problems such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic and duodenal ulcers, gastritis, esophagitis, and heartburn. It is an approved medicine with an authorised product in the European Union and is widely used for these conditions.

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
