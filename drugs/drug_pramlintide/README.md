## About

Pramlintide is an anti-diabetic medication used to lower blood glucose in people with type-1 diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2. It is an approved drug, but it is not authorised in the European Union and appears to be used mainly in the United States.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
