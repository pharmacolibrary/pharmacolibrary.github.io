### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge

**Steps:**
1. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `not_modelled` (reviewed 2026-09-11 08:46:45.656075+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-09-16 19:08:28.939247+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['F', 'Tlag']

**Interpretation flags:**
- built from REVIEW reference values (Henrich_2021) — secondary source
- volume reported by review

## Web simulation

Runs **this record's model** in your browser as WebAssembly — nothing to install. The sliders start at the extracted values; the reference check compares the browser's peak against the FMPy result recorded when the record was built, and is withheld once a value has been edited.
