### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** a compartment is unreachable, or a metabolite is unlinked

**Steps:**
1. Check the record's links in _interpretv2.yaml — every compartment needs a path to the dosed one.
2. Parent/metabolite records commonly miss the formation link.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-09-11 08:46:45.714133+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-09-16 19:15:46.800579+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped value-less row: 'Cor(Vc, CLc)' (captured trailing unit 'Vc, CLc' for child rows)
- dropped duplicate Q30 ('Q p (L/h)', value '587.93') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q45 ('fm2', value '0.960') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q63 ('V m1 (L)', value '51.45') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('CLm2 (L/h)', value '7.248') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q30 ('Q m2 (L/h)', value '4.476') — already have one for this compound
- dropped PD-category row 'K in' → Q327 (kin, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['psp413053-tbl-0002:row27:col1', 'psp413053-tbl-0002:row27:col2'])
- dropped PD-category row 'K out (h−1)' → Q328 (kout, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['psp413053-tbl-0002:row28:col1'])
- dropped PD-category row 'E max' → Q320 (Emax, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['psp413053-tbl-0002:row29:col1', 'psp413053-tbl-0002:row29:col2'])
- dropped PD-category row 'EC50 (ng/mL)' → Q321 (EC50, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['psp413053-tbl-0002:row30:col1'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Hill' → Q325 (Hill, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['psp413053-tbl-0002:row31:col1'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=clopidogrel
- topology: 2 first-order transfer(s) across 3 compounds → general_linear

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
