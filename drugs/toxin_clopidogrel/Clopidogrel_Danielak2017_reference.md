### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** every check the reviewer could run passed

**Steps:**
1. Confirm the model card and promote to 'curated' if it should be an exemplar. Promotion is a human decision; the reviewer never makes it.

<sub>owner: **curator** · guidance written by playbook</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-09-11 08:46:45.562259+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-09-16 19:15:34.395517+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'on FM (COV)b' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab2:row13:col1', 'Tab2:row13:col2'])
- dropped duplicate Q301 ('k12 and V2/F', value '-0.087') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=clopidogrel
- gap-filled Q76 (V/F) from Jiang_2025's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Henrich_2021's review values (primary lacked it)
- gap-filled Q83 (tlag) from Schilling_2020's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell Tab2:row13:col3 = '−0.48–−0.41'
- unparsed cell Tab2:row16:col3 = '−0.49–−0.42'
- unparsed cell Tab2:row17:col3 = '−0.68–−0.58'
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
