<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**AUC∞, CL and AUC have no unit.**

Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. Only the abstract was available, so reported summary statistics stand in for a fitted model. Extracted — clomipramine: t1/2z 12.3 h, AUC∞ 652 ngxh/mL, CL 0.393 L/hxkg, V 5 L/kg, MRT 13.5 h, AUC 948 ngxh/mL, Cmax 87.5 ng/mL, tmax 6.2 h, … (+1).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on bioavailability: this record has 90, the second reading none; it also differs on 10 more fields. That field does not shape the model.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'ngxh/mL' (AUC∞)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'L/hxkg' (CL)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'ngxh/mL' (AUC)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=clomipramine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Lainesse_2006_metadata.yaml (13 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
