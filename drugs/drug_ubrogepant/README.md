## About

**Description.** Ubrogepant is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura in adults.[L10926] It was approved by the FDA on December 23, 2019, and is the first oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist approved for the acute treatment of migraine.[L10959] Several oral small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, belonging to a class of medications referred to as "gepants", have been investigated for migraines, but only ubrogepant and [rimegepant] remain in clinical development.[A189207,A189213] Previous agents within this class were efficacious but limited by liver toxicity - this led to the development of ubrogepant, which was designed to be a hepatoxicity-free alternative to its predecessors.[A189195] Several parenteral monoclonal antibodies acting against the CGRP pathway (e.g. [erenumab], [fremanezumab], [galcanezumab]) have also been approved in recent years.[A189207] Ubrogepant was approved by Health Canada on November 10, 2022.[L43987]

Compared to the current standard of therapy for migraine treatment, namely triptans such as [sumatriptan] and [almotriptan], CGRP antagonists present several advantages.[A189195] They appear to be better tolerated, do not contribute to medication overuse headaches, and carry no apparent cardiovascular risk, making them suitable for use in patients with cardiovascular disease.[A189195] The development of oral gepants, including ubrogepant, may therefore constitute a significant advance in migraine headache treatment and may become the new standard of therapy in the treatment of this debilitating condition.

**Indication.** Ubrogepant is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.[L10926,L43987]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
