The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Gupta_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a clinical trial comparing blood loss outcomes, not a pharmacokinetic study, and reports no PK parameters for aminocaproic acid. |
| popPK | Janecki_1991 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro study on Sertoli cell tight junctions where aminocaproic acid is used only as an antiprotease control, not as a subject drug for pharmacokinetic analysis. |

| popPK | Wagner_2017 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The study is an in vitro assessment of drug sequestration in an ECMO circuit and does not report pharmacokinetic disposition parameters (CL, V, ka) for aminocaproic acid. |
