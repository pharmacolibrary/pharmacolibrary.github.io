<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Compound 39 (measured concentrations) drives name (in fold induction): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Compound 39 (concentrations in μM, no PK model) stimulates CYP3A4 mRNA (fold induction) indirectly by activating CAR: it upregulated CYP3A4 mRNA in HepaRG cells but not in CAR-knockout HepaRG or LS174T cells (which lack functional CAR), and in humanized mice at a single 1 mg/kg dose. The paper does not give an Emax/EC50 for the CYP3A4 mRNA response itself, since dose–response curves for CAR2/CAR3 activation did not plateau up to 30 μM; the listed EC50 values are for CAR receptor assays (e.g., TR-FRET CAR EC50 of 0.012 μM for CITCO and 0.009 μM for 15i; CAR AA EC50 of 1.16 μM for compound 2 and 0.05 μM for 15a), not for CYP3A4 mRNA. Separately, compound 39 directly inhibits CYP3A4 enzymatic a
