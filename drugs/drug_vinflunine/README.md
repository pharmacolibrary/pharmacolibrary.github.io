## About

**Description.** Vinflunine is a third-generation member of the vinca alkaloid family with anti-tumour actions. It was first described in 1998 at the Pierre Fabre research center in France. Like other vinca agents, vinflunine is an anti-mitotic agent that induces a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and promotes cell death via apoptosis [L1396]. Vinflunine is a microtubule inhibitor that binds to tubulin at or near to the vinca binding sites to inhibits its polymerization into microtubules during cell proliferation [L1396]. In murine tumors and human tumor xenografts, vinflunine exhibits an antitumor efficacy than [DB00361], [DB00570], and [DB00541] [A31975]. 

Having an incidence of 429,700 new cases per year worldwide, urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is one of the most common malignancies that mostly affects individuals aged 50–79 years [A32626]. Some patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma experience inadequate therapeutic response from a prior platinum-containing regimen. While these patients have a median survival of approximately 4 months and a poor prognosis [L1396], there is currently no standard therapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma [A32626]. In 2009, vinflunine was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a second-line therapy of metastatic and advanced urothelial cancer after failure of platinum-based treatment [A32626]. Vinflunine ditartrate is an active ingredient in the EMA-authorised product Javlor for intravenous infusion. Efficacy and safety of vinflunine has not been studied in patients with performance status of 2 or less. The clinical use of vinflunine in other urologic malignancies, such as inoperable cancer of the penis, are currently have been investigated [A32626].

**Indication.** For use as a monotherapy in adults with advanced or transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a prior platinum-containing therapy [L2381].

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
