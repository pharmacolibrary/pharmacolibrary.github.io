<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The isosorbide dinitrate record was rejected because its metabolites, isosorbide 5-mononitrate and isosorbide 2-mononitrate, are unlinked from the dose, and the model was built from the abstract only.**

The metabolism links from isosorbide dinitrate to both mononitrate metabolites carry no usable rate constant, so the metabolites have no path from the dose and the structure check failed. The record is abstract-only: the reported summary statistics (t1/2z 4.7 minutes, Vss 90 L, CL 136 L/hr, bioavailability 29%) stand in for a fitted model rather than coming from one. Extracted — isosorbide dinitrate: t1/2z 4.7 minutes, Vss 90 L, CL 136 L/hr, Fab 29 %.

**Model structure:** general linear; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 4 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('terminal disappearance t1/2', value 54.7) — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('terminal t1/2', value 4.33) — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=isosorbide dinitrate
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: 2 first-order transfer(s) across 3 compounds → general_linear
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- unit re-normalised: t1/2z 'minutes' now converts (value unchanged)

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Straehl_1985_metadata.yaml (10 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
