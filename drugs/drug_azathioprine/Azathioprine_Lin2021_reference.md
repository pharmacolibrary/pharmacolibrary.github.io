**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The azathioprine model record was rejected because its structure leaves a compartment or metabolite (6-thioguanine nucleotides) with no path from the dose, making the PK parameters unusable.**

The record describes a one-compartment structure for azathioprine with the measured compound 6-thioguanine nucleotides, carrying parameters CL 11.6 L/h, V2 809 L, an allometric weight exponent of 0.625, a TPMT covariate effect of 0.515, and a θ MESA coefficient of 0.802. The rejection rests on an orphan compartment or unlinked metabolite: the measured 6-thioguanine nucleotide entity has no connection from the administered dose, so the clearance and volume values cannot be interpreted within the model. The second reader's disagreements concern only naming of the analyte (6-TGN versus 6-thioguanine nucleotides) and whether the θ MESA coefficient of 0.802 belongs in the record, not the structural defect. Extracted — 6-thioguanine nucleotides: CL 11.6 L/h, allometric_exponent 0.625, V2 809 L.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which molecule was measured: this record has 6-thioguanine nucleotides, the second reading 6-TGN; it also differs on 2 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- kept covariate coefficient θ MESA=0.802 (covariate MESA) — not an ontology parameter
- covariate level 'θ TPMT' → Q900:tpmt = 0.515 (linear_fractional on Q22)
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('η CL', value '0.342') — already have one for this compound
- dropped diagnostic row 'η CL -shrinkage (%)' → Q318 (shrinkage) — reported statistic, not a parameter
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ε' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_2:row14:col1', 'tab_2:row14:col2', 'tab_2:row14:col3', 'tab_2:row14:col4', 'tab_2:row14:col5'])
- dropped diagnostic row 'ε-shrinkage (%)' → Q318 (shrinkage) — reported statistic, not a parameter
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=6-thioguanine nucleotides
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures '6-thioguanine nucleotides', not azathioprine — the review values are the parent's

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 3
