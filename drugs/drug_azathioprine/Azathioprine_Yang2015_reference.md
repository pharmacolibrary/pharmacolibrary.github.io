A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**Only volume was extracted — no clearance; v/F has no unit.**

A model needs both clearance and volume; without the clearance it could only be built on a library default, so it was not. Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. A reported unit could not be converted (V/F), so that value has no SI equivalent. None of the extracted parameters is azathioprine's own; they describe unknown. Extracted — unknown: V 0.18 l/kg, V/F 0.78 1/kg, tlag 0.349 h, kabs 0.869 h−1.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `needs_review` (reviewed 2026-10-05 09:24:12.746664+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-06 23:43:06.753486+00:00). Current validate status: `needs_review`.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="azathioprine" model-id="Azathioprine_Yang2015_reference" status="needs_review" stale="true" population="SLE patients" measured-compound="unknown" parameterization="apparent" topology="2C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 2-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 4 extracted.

**Parameterization:** V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

- salvaged Q49 ('absorption rate constant (Ka)'=0.869) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=unknown
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- structure disagreement: deterministic 2C vs LLM 1C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- molar mass: none found for 'unknown' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures 'unknown', not azathioprine — the review values are the parent's
