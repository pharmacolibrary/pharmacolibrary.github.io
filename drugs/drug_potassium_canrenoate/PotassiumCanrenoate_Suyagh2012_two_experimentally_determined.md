**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The model does not reproduce the paper's terminal half-life (model/paper ratio 2.53).**

Simulated as the paper dosed it, the model's terminal half-life differs from the value the paper reports by more than the tolerance. None of the extracted parameters is potassium canrenoate's own; they describe canrenone. Extracted — canrenone: CL/F 12.7 L/h, V/F 520 L, kfm 4.48 1/h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[cl/f (l/hr/70 kg) θcl/f].value`: this record has 12.73, the second reading 14.13; it also differs on 6 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `needs_review` (reviewed 2026-10-05 09:30:33.230067+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-06 18:31:18.058956+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `potassium canrenoate`, measured `canrenone`.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)
- `input_model`: first-order depot input — apparent (/F) parameterization ⇒ extravascular dosing

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'MOFV' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Suyagh_2012_table_2:row0:col3'])
- covariate effect for Q319 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- covariate effect for Q76 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- implicit units: 'CL/F (L/hr/70 kg) θCL/F' → L/h (from the paper text: "Table 2 caption and row label state 'CL/F (L/hr/70 kg)' and the text states 'Typical population estimates of CL/F ... we")
- implicit units: 'V/F (L/70 kg) θV/F' → L (from the paper text: "Table 2 caption and row label state 'V/F (L/70 kg)' and the text states 'Typical population estimates of ... V/F ... wer")
- implicit units: 'kf (hr⁻¹) θkf' → 1/h (from the paper text: "Table 2 row label states 'kf (hr -1)'.")
- metabolite canrenone: Q27→Q375 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided), normalised to a standard size
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=canrenone
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- 1C volume normalization: Q290→Q76 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'V/F (L/70 kg) θV/F' is the general volume)
- population split: 'two experimentally determined θs (one for each exponent) estimate' subgroup of Suyagh_2012 (paper reports 2 populations: median, two experimentally determined θs (one for each exponent) estimate)
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 14/14 row label(s) assigned, 38 linked by role

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2, 4
- dropped sensitivity-analysis table(s) 3 from the LLM selection — perturbations of a model, not a model
