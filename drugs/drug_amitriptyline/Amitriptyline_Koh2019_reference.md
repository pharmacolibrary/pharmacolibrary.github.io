A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The clearance plausibility check could not be computed.**

The check had no reference to compare the clearance against, so the value is unverified rather than shown to be wrong. Extracted — amitriptyline: CL 92.1 L/h, V 155 L, Q 109 L/h, kabs 0.125 1/h, tlag 0.414 h, D1 1.13 h, kcomp 0.00581 1/h, k41 80.4 1/h, … (+1); nortriptyline: CL 58.2 L/h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[d1].value`: this record has 0.95, the second reading 1.13; it also differs on 13 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('TVCL TPM, AMIT , L/h', value '35.8') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('TVCL MRM, AMIT , L/h', value '61.5') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('TVCL MPM, AMIT , L/h', value '17') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('TVCL ORM, AMIT , L/h', value '30.6') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('TVCL OPM, AMIT , L/h', value '18.8') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q81 ('MTIME2, h', value '2.65') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'K56, 1/h' → Q30 (unit '1 / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'K65, 1/h' → Q30 (unit '1 / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q30 ('K65, 1/h', value '0.168') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q22 (TVCL TRM, AMIT , L/h); Q63 (TVV c, AMIT , L); Q30 (TVQ, L/h); Q61 (TVV p, AMIT , L); Q22 (CL T, NOR , L/h); Q30 (K56, 1/h)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=amitriptyline
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- template fit: PK_3M_9C — formed from central; parent 1, metabolites [0]
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles: 6 per-group rows of amitriptyline clearance but 2 reference group(s) — kept as printed
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 29/29 row label(s) assigned, 42 linked by role; re-tagged parent→nortriptyline ×15
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
