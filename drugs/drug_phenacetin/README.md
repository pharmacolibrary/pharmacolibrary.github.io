## About

Phenacetin is a non-opioid painkiller and fever reducer that was once used to treat pain and high temperature. It has been withdrawn from the market because it was found to be carcinogenic and harmful to the kidneys.

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.
