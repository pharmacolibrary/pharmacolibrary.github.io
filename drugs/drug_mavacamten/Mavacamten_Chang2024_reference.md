**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**The record was rejected because a biomarker parameter, creatinine clearance of 115 mL/min, was recorded as a mavacamten disposition parameter instead of the drug's clearance.**

The parameter labelled 'Creatinine clearance, mL/min' with value 115 mL/min is a participant biomarker covariate, not mavacamten clearance, so the analyte identity check failed. The true drug parameters are apparent oral values: CL/F 0.914 L/h, V2/F 6.63 L, Q/F 16.3 L/h and absorption rate constant 0.301 h-1, with F=1 and Fm=1 assumed and no molar correction. Vd and Tlag had no source values, so library defaults were substituted. A second reader places the 115 mL/min value as the participants' mean creatinine clearance rather than a disposition parameter, and reads a CYP2C19 rapid-metabolizer effect on CL/F of 0.2 that this record lacks; the covariate effects were defined but only the reference individual was simulated. Extracted — mavacamten: CL 115 mL/min, CL/F 0.914 L/h, V2/F 6.63 L, Q/F 16.3 L/h, kabs 0.301 h -1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of alag1: this record has none, the second reading 0.192. That field does not shape the model.

**Parameters:** 1 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, Q/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped value-less row: 'V2/F'
- dropped value-less row: 'V3/F'
- dropped value-less row: 'KA'
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ALAG1' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp413197-tbl-0003:row6:col1', 'psp413197-tbl-0003:row6:col2'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=mavacamten
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell psp413197-tbl-0003:row2:col1 = '6.63 L'
- unparsed cell psp413197-tbl-0003:row3:col1 = '252 L'
- unparsed cell psp413197-tbl-0003:row5:col1 = '0.301 h−1'
