**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**The record was rejected because a biomarker parameter, creatinine clearance of 115 mL/min, was recorded as a mavacamten disposition parameter instead of the drug's clearance.**

The parameter labelled 'Creatinine clearance, mL/min' with value 115 mL/min is a participant biomarker covariate, not mavacamten clearance, so the analyte identity check failed. The true drug parameters are apparent oral values: CL/F 0.914 L/h, V2/F 6.63 L, Q/F 16.3 L/h and absorption rate constant 0.301 h-1, with F=1 and Fm=1 assumed and no molar correction. Vd and Tlag had no source values, so library defaults were substituted. A second reader places the 115 mL/min value as the participants' mean creatinine clearance rather than a disposition parameter, and reads a CYP2C19 rapid-metabolizer effect on CL/F of 0.2 that this record lacks; the covariate effects were defined but only the reference individual was simulated. Extracted — mavacamten: CL 115 mL/min, CL/F 0.914 L/h, V2/F 6.63 L, Q/F 16.3 L/h, kabs 0.301 h -1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of cl/f: this record has 0.914, the second reading none; it also differs on 3 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- covariate wt for CL/F from footnote/prose kept as documentation only (['fig_4:caption'])
- covariate wt for Q/F from footnote/prose kept as documentation only (['fig_4:caption'])
- salvaged Q22 ('Creatinine clearance, mL/min'=115) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q27 ('CL/F'=0.914) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q82 ('V2/F'=6.63) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q69 ('Q/F'=16.3) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q49 ('KA'=0.301) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=mavacamten
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- text-pointer recovery: parsed 0 structural record(s) from the flattened table 3 sentence
