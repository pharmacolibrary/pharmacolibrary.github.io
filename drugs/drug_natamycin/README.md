## About

Natamycin is an antifungal antibiotic used to treat fungal infections, including eye infections such as conjunctivitis, keratitis and blepharitis, and various fungal diseases like candidiasis and aspergillosis. It is an approved medicine, appears on the WHO essential medicines list, and is used topically in several areas including the mouth, gut, skin, gynecological and ophthalmological applications.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.
