<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

<dbs-pgx drug="abemaciclib" model-id="Abemaciclib_Chigutsa2020_external_validation_with_phase_iii" status="rejected" stale="false" population="healthy subjects and patients with cancer" measured-compound="abemaciclib" parameterization="mechanistic" topology="general_linear"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** general linear; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 8 extracted, plus 2 covariate effects.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label (paper)</code></td><td>the row or statistic label exactly as printed in the paper (label_verbatim) — never normalised, so it can be found in the PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Q-code · name</code></td><td>the ontology parameter this label was matched to (Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F, Q49 = ka, Q57 = half-life, …) and its canonical name. The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Patients a , a 200 mg N = 421' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Chigutsa_2020_table_3:row0:col6'])
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number '0.846' (source ['psp412544-tbl-0002:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number '0.968' (source ['psp412544-tbl-0002:footnote', 'psp412544-tbl-0002:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number '6' (source ['psp412544-tbl-0002:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- unit inherited for t1/2z (Q57): 'h' from a same-Q-code sibling (this row's label had no unit)
- covariate effect for Q25 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- covariate effect for Q27 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- salvaged Q22 ('plasma clearance'=22.8) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=abemaciclib
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'external validation with phase iii data' subgroup of Chigutsa_2020 (paper reports 5 populations: % variability a , a (%see), estimate (%see), external validation with phase iii data, nca(200 mg), semimechanistic model development)
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 35/35 row label(s) assigned, 44 linked by role; re-tagged parent→M2 (LSN2839567) ×39, parent→M20 (LSN3106726) ×6, abemaciclib→parent ×4
- molar mass: no plausible PubChem entry for 'M2 (LSN2839567)' ('no full name in the paper') — left in mass units
- molar mass: no plausible PubChem entry for 'M20 (LSN3106726)' ('no full name in the paper') — left in mass units
- molar mass: none found for 'M2 (LSN2839567)' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- molar mass: none found for 'M20 (LSN3106726)' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- skipped review gap-fill of V from Fleisher_2021: its label names a different analyte ('liposomal') — 'VL Vd of liposomal drug'
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Fleisher_2021's review values (primary lacked it)
