<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**The voxelotor record was held back because the model builder invented an absorption rate constant (ka defaulted, not reported in the source) and left ka and Tlag without source values, so the record deviates from the published model.**

The paper reports kabs = 2.38 1/h for voxelotor, yet the model builder substituted placeholder values for ka and Tlag because no values were extracted from the source, and adjudication flagged the invented absorption as not acceptable. The record also assumes F=1, Fm=1 and no molar correction (apparent parameterization), so the reported CL/F = 6.14 L/h, V1/F = 333 L, Q/F = 0.39 L/h and V2/F = 72.3 L are used as apparent values. In addition, the covariate effect (cyp3a4_inducer_on_cl_f_expth = 0.39) was defined but not exercised: only the reference individual was simulated, not the covariate scenarios. Extracted — voxelotor: CL/F 6.14 L/h, V1/F 333 L, Q/F 0.39 L/h, V2/F 72.3 L, Kp 0.43, kabs 2.38.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['ka', 'Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)
- `invented_absorption`: ka defaulted — not reported in source

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'R bp' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp412731-tbl-0002:row6:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Blood volume on V c/F, (BLV/3.89 c )TH' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp412731-tbl-0002:row8:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Hematocrit on R bp, (HCT/27.8)TH' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp412731-tbl-0002:row9:col1'])
- covariate level 'CYP3A4 inducer on CL/F, expTH' → Q900:cyp3a4_inducer_on_cl_f_expth = 0.39 (linear_fractional on Q27)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Nominal dose on R bp, (dose/900)TH' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp412731-tbl-0002:row11:col1'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=voxelotor
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
