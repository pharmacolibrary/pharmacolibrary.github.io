<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Ivosidenib (measured concentrations) drives name (in msec): direct linear effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Plasma ivosidenib concentrations (ng/ml) act directly (no hysteresis, no effect compartment) on the change from baseline in QTcF (msec) via a linear concentration–response relationship with a slope of 0.00258 msec/(ng/ml); at the geometric mean Cmax of 6551 ng/ml for the 500 mg q.d. dose, ΔQTcF was predicted to be 17.2 msec (90% CI 14.7–19.7). Lower electrolyte levels (calcium, magnesium), increased age, and lower baseline QTcF were associated with increased ΔQTcF; no Imax/IC50/EC50/Emax/kin/kout/ke0 values are given.
