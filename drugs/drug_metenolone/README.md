<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Abdul_2024 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on microbial biotransformation and in-vitro aromatase inhibition, not pharmacokinetic disposition parameters. |
| PD | Abdul_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports in vitro aromatase inhibition IC50 values for metabolites, which is a pharmacological potency assay, not a pharmacodynamic (exposure-response) relationship for the drug metenolone itself. |
| popPK | Garbrecht_1981 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on lipid metabolism side effects (hyperlipoproteinaemia) and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters for methenolone. |
| PD | Garbrecht_1981 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper reports a qualitative observation of hyperlipoproteinaemia and explicitly states there was no relationship between cholesterol levels and dosage, providing no numeric PD parameters or concentration-effect data. |
| popPK | Hussain_2016 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on fungal biotransformation and immunomodulatory activity of methenolone enanthate, not pharmacokinetic disposition parameters. |
| popPK | Shen_2009 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on hair analysis for doping control and explicitly states that metenolone does not deposit in hair, providing no pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| PD | Shen_2009 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports that methenolone does not deposit in hair and focuses on the time-course of concentration in hair for other steroids, providing no pharmacodynamic (effect) data or exposure-response relationship for metenolone. |
| popPK | Siddiqui_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a study on fungal biocatalysis and structural transformation of metenolone acetate, reporting no pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| PD | Siddiqui_2020 | not_relevant | 2 | 2 | The paper reports single-point IC50 values for specific metabolites in cell assays, but does not provide a concentration-effect curve, Emax, or a PK/PD model for metenolone itself. |
