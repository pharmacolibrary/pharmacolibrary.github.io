**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**The vortioxetine parent–metabolite model was quarantined because vortioxetine's bioavailability (F), clearance (CL) and absorption lag time (Tlag) had no extracted values and library placeholder values were substituted instead.**

The record lists kabs 0.160 1/h, V1 1510 L, Q 21.1 L/h and V2 571 L for vortioxetine, and kabs 0.281 1/h, fm 0.190, V1 155 L, CL 22.5 L/h, Q 7.69 L/h and V2 211 L for Lu AA34443, but F, CL and Tlag for the parent had no value, so placeholders stood in and the model was held back rather than published with invented numbers. The model structure also did not match the paper: a parent–metabolite hepatic structure with three compartments was expected, but a one-compartment enteral structure was obtained. The covariate effects defined in the record (e.g. theta_q370_cyp2d6 13.1 and theta_q22_cyp2c19 12.5) were not exercised in simulation, which simulated only the reference individual. A second reader additionally reported covariate parameters absent from this record, such as theta_cl_age 0.157 and theta_v3_height 1.48. Extracted — vortioxetine: kabs 0.16 1/h, V1 1.51e+03 L, Q 21.1 L/h, V2 571 L, tlag 0.966 h; Lu AA34443: kabs 0.281 1/h, fm 0.19, Q 7.69 L/h, V1 155 L, CL 22.5 L/h, V2 211 L.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[lu aa34443 clearance, clmet].covariate_forms`: this record has ['linear_fractional'], the second reading ['linear_fractional', 'linear_fractional']; it also differs on 5 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

**Reviewer per-scenario checks:**

| check | scenario | status | expected | obtained | ratio | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T2_covariates_not_exercised | (all) | fail | not captured | not captured | not captured | record has covariate_effects but the engineer simulated only the reference individual — covariate scenarios were not exercised |
| T0_analyte_identity | not captured | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | V/CL labels are the drug's (or a metabolite's), no biomarker signal |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | pass | 10 scholar param(s) emitted or defaulted | 10 covered | not captured | all structural parameters accounted for |
| T3_topology_template | not captured | fail | parent_metabolite_hepatic → PK_3M_3C* | PK_1C_enteral | not captured | engineer template must match the scholar topology |
| T6_deviations | not captured | fail | not captured | defaulted_parameters: not acceptable | not captured | LLM adjudication → deterministic rule |
| T1_t_half_beta | reference | skipped | 66 | not captured | not captured | no simulated metric for this quantity (single reference sim) |

<summary>Check legend — what each column means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>check</code></td><td>the check id. C0_has_structural_params = at least one numeric structural parameter; C0b_disposition_core = a volume OR a clearance/elimination term (neither means an exposure/outcome paper, not popPK — rejected); C0c_disposition_complete = BOTH a volume AND a clearance/elimination term, which is what the engineer needs to build (one without the other routes to review, never to the engineer); C1_half_life(_beta) = reported half-life against V and CL; C2_reference = covariate scenarios are sign-plausible; C3_cl_dose_auc = CL against dose/AUC; C4_auc_closed_form = AUC recomputed in closed form; C5_dimension_&lt;Qcode&gt; = the parameter's units carry the dimension its Q-code requires.</td></tr><tr><td><code>status</code></td><td>pass, fail, or skipped. A skipped check had nothing to compare — the paper did not report the input it needs — and is not evidence against the record. The scholar table lists only pass and fail; the reviewer table also shows skipped, with the reason in note.</td></tr><tr><td><code>expected</code></td><td>the value the check required, from the paper or from the ontology.</td></tr><tr><td><code>obtained</code></td><td>what the record actually yields.</td></tr><tr><td><code>ratio</code></td><td>obtained / expected, where the check is a numeric comparison.</td></tr><tr><td><code>tol</code></td><td>the tolerance the ratio had to fall within to pass.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>the artifact the expected value was taken from.</td></tr><tr><td><code>scenario</code></td><td>reviewer table only — the covariate scenario the check was run under.</td></tr><tr><td><code>note</code></td><td>why a check was skipped, or how it was judged.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>
