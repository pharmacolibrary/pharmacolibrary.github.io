## About

**Description.** Cinitapride is a gastroprokinetic agent and antiulcer benzamide with agonist activity at 5-HT1 and 5-HT4 receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT2 receptors. It is marketed in Spain and Mexico.

**Indication.** It is indicated to treat gastrointestinal disorders associated with motility disturbances like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), non-ulcer dyspepsia and delayed gastric emptying.

<summary>What the PGx columns mean</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>gene</code></td><td>the gene whose variants the record is about. One record per gene, so a paper reporting several genes appears on several rows.</td></tr><tr><td><code>affects</code></td><td>the PK or PD parameter the genotype SHIFTS, as an ontology Q-code plus its name — Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F (apparent clearance), Q32 = Cmax, Q88 = AUC, Q40 = Fab, Q321 = EC50, Q322 = IC50, Q305 = kfm. The record's per-phenotype theta is a multiplier ON that parameter: a poor-metaboliser theta shifts this value, it does not supply one. Two values are NOT parameters — Q100 (NIL) is an association or risk finding with no parameter target, and `safety` is an adverse-reaction risk such as an HLA allele. A PA… id instead of a Q-code marks a record derived from a ClinPGx/PharmGKB guideline lookup rather than read out of the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>mechanism</code></td><td>how the gene acts: metabolism, transport, target, formation, safety_allele, or unknown.</td></tr><tr><td><code>detail</code></td><td>the paper stem, linking to the full record page.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<summary>Badge legend — what each badge means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
