## About

**Description.** Fitusiran is an antithrombin-directed double-stranded small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) that is covalently linked to a ligand containing a triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) moiety.[L52860] Fitusiran was first approved by the FDA on March 28, 2025, as routine prophylaxis therapy to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes associated with hemophilia A or B.[L52865] By causing the degradation of antithrombin mRNA and promoting thrombin generation, fitusiran works to restore hemostasis in patients with hemophilia.[A273770]

**Indication.** Fitusiran is indicated for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with hemophilia A or B with or without factor VIII or IX inhibitors.[L52860]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
