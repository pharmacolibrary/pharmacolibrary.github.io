## About

Prenalterol is a sympathomimetic, beta-1 adrenergic agonist that was investigated as a cardiotonic agent for heart conditions. It is considered experimental and does not appear to be an approved medicine today.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
