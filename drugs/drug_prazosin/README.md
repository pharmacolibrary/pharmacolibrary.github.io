## About

Prazosin is an alpha-blocker used to treat high blood pressure, and has also been used for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, prostate enlargement, Raynaud disease, and urinary retention. It is an approved medicine and remains in use, though it is not authorised centrally in the European Union.

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
