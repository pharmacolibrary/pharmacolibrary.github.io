## About

Trimetaphan is a ganglion-blocking antihypertensive drug used to treat arterial hypertension and as an adjuvant in anesthesia. It is an approved drug, but its use today is uncommon and largely limited to specialised hospital settings for rapid blood-pressure control.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
