A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The lumiracoxib record was rejected because the structural parameter kel (0.21) failed a dimension check and the COX-2 interconversion link leaves a compartment unreachable from the dose, with the COX-2•h⁻² unit of A (1.42) unconvertible to SI.**

The elimination rate constant kel, labelled kS_COX-2 with value 0.21, was flagged as a dimension mismatch on a structural parameter, and the link from lumiracoxib to COX-2 as interconversion produced an unreachable compartment or unlinked metabolite. The AUC parameter A carries the unit COX-2•h⁻², which could not be converted to SI units, so it reached the model without an SI value. A second reader also disagreed on the links (recording none) and on parameter assignments, reading 0.33 and 62 where this record has null and 0.89 for KD, and a different identifier for the C0 (LT0, 13 s) parameter. Extracted — lumiracoxib: kel 0.21, AUC 1.42 COX-2•h -2, KD 0.89 h -1, C0 13 s.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the links between molecules: this record has lumiracoxib → cox-2 (interconversion), the second reading none; it also differs on 5 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'COX-2•h -2' (AUC)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'a' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_2:row4:col1', 'tab_2:row4:col3'])
- dropped duplicate Q47 ('b (h -1 )', value '0.33') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'kD_COX-2 (h -1 )' → Q331 (unit '1 / [time]' vs ontology '[mass] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'mg•mL -1' (KD)
- dropped duplicate Q331 ('KD (mg•mL -1 )', value '62') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'LT0 (s)' → Q86 (unit '[time]' vs ontology '[mass] * [time] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped value-less row: 'CP'
- dropped value-less row: 'COX-2'
- dropped value-less row: 'KA'
- dropped value-less row: 'kD_COX-2'
- dropped value-less row: 'kS_COX-2'
- dropped value-less row: 'Tlag'
- dropped value-less row: 'MED'
- dropped value-less row: 'Q'
- dropped value-less row: 'CL'
- dropped value-less row: 'Vc'
- dropped value-less row: 'VT'
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=lumiracoxib
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
