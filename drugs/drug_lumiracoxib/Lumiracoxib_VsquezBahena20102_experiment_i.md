A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

> **Species: rat.** This record comes from an animal study (rat), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the links between molecules: this record has lumiracoxib → cox-2 (interconversion), the second reading none; it also differs on 5 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

> ℹ️ No reviewer record yet — status shown is the scholar **validate** result; simulation-based reviewer checks have not been run.

The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section residual_error: 'Additive (mg•mL -1 )' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual error')
- table section residual_error: 'Proportional (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual error')
- column 'experiment i' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'kS_COX-2 (COX-2•h -1 ) a' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_2:row2:col1', 'tab_2:row2:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'A (COX-2•h -2 )' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_2:row3:col1', 'tab_2:row3:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'a' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_2:row4:col1', 'tab_2:row4:col3'])
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'kD_COX-2 (h -1 )' → Q331 (unit '1 / [time]' vs ontology '[mass] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'mg•mL -1' (KD)
- dropped duplicate Q331 ('KD (mg•mL -1 )', value '0.33') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'LT0 (s)' → Q306 (unit '[time]' vs ontology '1 / [time]') — route to review
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=lumiracoxib
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- 1C volume normalization: Q63→Q61 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'Vc (L)' is the general volume)
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'experiment i' subgroup of Vásquez-Bahena_2010_2 (paper reports 3 populations: estimate, experiment i, experiment i and ii)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell Vásquez-Bahena_2010_2_table_1:row6:col1 = '= -1'
- unparsed cell Vásquez-Bahena_2010_2_table_1:row6:col8 = 'D50 (mg•kg -1 ) 4.3 (43) IMAX 0.67 (6)'
- companion parameter table 1 transcribed (13 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 1
