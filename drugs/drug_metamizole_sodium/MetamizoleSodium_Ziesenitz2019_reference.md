**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The metamizole sodium record was rejected because it contains no distribution volume and no clearance or elimination for 4-methylaminoantipyrine — only an AUC∞ of 29.9 mg/L/h — so it is an exposure/outcome paper, not a compartmental population PK model.**

The record is abstract-only, so the reported summary statistic (AUC∞ of 4-methylaminoantipyrine in children 2–6 years, 29.9 mg/L/h) stood in for a fitted model, and no volume or clearance parameters exist. A dimension mismatch was also flagged on a structural parameter. A second reader disagreed on the dose compound (metamizole), the primary analyte (4-methylaminoantipyrine), and the model links, arguing the metabolite 4-methylaminoantipyrine should be linked to metamizole sodium by hydrolysis, whereas the record has no such link. Extracted — 4-methylaminoantipyrine: AUC∞ 29.9 mg/L/h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has metamizole, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 2 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by glm-5.3-flash</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `metamizole`, measured `4-methylaminoantipyrine`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'AUC0-inf of 4-methylaminoantipyrine in children 2-6 years' → Q17 (unit '[mass] / [length] ** 3 / [time]' vs ontology '[mass] * [time] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped value-less row: 'AUCref (80-125% range'
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'AUC0-inf of 4-methylaminoantipyrine in infants &lt; 2 years' → Q17 (unit '[mass] / [length] ** 3 / [time]' vs ontology '[mass] * [time] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q17 ('AUC0-inf of 4-methylaminoantipyrine in infants &lt; 2 years', value 43.6) — already have one for this compound
- dropped value-less row: 'reduced weight-based IV dosing in infants &lt; 1 year compared with infants and children up to 6 years'
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=4-methylaminoantipyrine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- template fit: none — noncompartmental model — not a compartmental parent–metabolite model
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles: 2 per-group rows of 4-methylaminoantipyrine summary_statistic but 0 reference group(s) — kept as printed
- row roles (LLM): model_class=noncompartmental; 4/4 row label(s) assigned, 0 linked by role
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures '4-methylaminoantipyrine', not metamizole_sodium — the review values are the parent's

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Ziesenitz_2019_metadata.yaml (4 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
