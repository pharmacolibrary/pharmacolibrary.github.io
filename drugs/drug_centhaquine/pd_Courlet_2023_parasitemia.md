<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Cabamiquine (measured concentrations) drives name (in parasites/mL): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Cabamiquine central compartment concentrations (ng/mL) drive parasite killing in a turnover (sigmoid Emax) model of blood-stage parasitemia (parasites/mL) in IBSM and SpzCh challenge studies, with an additional liver-stage EC50; the drug acts by stimulating parasite killing (kki) via an Emax function, with a delay rate constant kt = 0.030 /h handling the delayed onset of effect. Key potency estimates: EC50,b,IBSM = 7.60 ng/mL (RSE 10.2%), EC50,b,SpzCh = 1.29 ng/mL, and EC50,l = 0.66 ng/mL (RSE 19.9%), with baseline parasitemia P0 = 0.03 parasites/mL; the paper does not state Imax/Emax, kin, kout, ke0, or gamma values in the excerpts.

Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.
