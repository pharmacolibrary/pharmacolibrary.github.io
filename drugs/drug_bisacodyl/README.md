## About

**Description.** Bisacodyl, a diphenylmethane derivative, is a commonly used over the counter stimulant laxative for occasional constipation.[A233300,L13362] Both bisacodyl and [picosulfate] are metabolized to the same active metabolite bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridyl-2-methane (BHPM).[A233290,A233300,A207700]

Bisacodyl was patented on 25 September 1956[L33045] but has been used as a laxative since 1952.[A233300]

**Indication.** Bisacodyl is indicated to relieve occasional constipation and irregularity.[L13362]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
