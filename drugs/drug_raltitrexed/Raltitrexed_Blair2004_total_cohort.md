<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for raltitrexed's clearance.**

The model was built, but raltitrexed's clearance had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. A reported unit could not be converted (CL), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — raltitrexed: CL 33 %, V 6.65 l, Q 0.54 l h -1.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `model_quarantined` (reviewed 2026-09-28 14:39:31.052499+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 17:17:54.984920+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Number of patients' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row1:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Number of courses' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row2:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Number of observations' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row3:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Number of observations per patient 15 ± 3 (3-22)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row4:col3'])
- table mostly unlinked (4/4 table-cell rows NIL) — likely the wrong table was located, not 0 genuinely-missing ontology parameter(s); route_to_review instead of building a model from the residual linked cell(s)
- salvaged Q22 ('CL (l h -1 )'=2.06) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q61 ('V (l)'=6.65) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q30 ('q 1'=0.54) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=raltitrexed
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'total cohort' subgroup of Blair_2004 (paper reports 3 populations: model development, model validation, total cohort)
