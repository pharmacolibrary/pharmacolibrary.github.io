<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for raltitrexed's clearance.**

The model was built, but raltitrexed's clearance had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. A reported unit could not be converted (CL), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — raltitrexed: CL 33 %, V 6.65 l, Q 0.54 l h -1.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="raltitrexed" model-id="Raltitrexed_Blair2004_model_development" status="model_quarantined" stale="false" population="patients with advanced solid tumours" measured-compound="raltitrexed" parameterization="mechanistic" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment, IV mammillary model — template `PK_1C`.  
**Parameters:** 3 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `model_quarantined`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Number of patients' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row1:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Number of courses' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row2:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Number of observations' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row3:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Weight (kg)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row8:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Estimated creatinine clearance' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row10:col1'])
- table mostly unlinked (5/5 table-cell rows NIL) — likely the wrong table was located, not 0 genuinely-missing ontology parameter(s); route_to_review instead of building a model from the residual linked cell(s)
- salvaged Q22 ('interpatient variability in raltitrexed clearance'=33) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q61 ('V (l)'=6.65) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q30 ('q 1'=0.54) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=raltitrexed
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'model development' subgroup of Blair_2004 (paper reports 3 populations: model development, model validation, total cohort)
