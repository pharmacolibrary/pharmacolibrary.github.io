- **ATC codes:** `B01AB05`

## About

**Description.** Enoxaparin is a common low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) used in the prevention and management of various thromboembolic disorders. Initially approved by the FDA in 1993, it is administered by a subcutaneous or intravenous injection and marketed by several pharmaceutical companies.[L31393] Enoxaparin markedly reduces the incidence of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients when compared to unfractionated [heparin], without increasing the risk of serious bleeding.[A228178,A228313]

**Indication.** Enoxaparin is indicated for the prevention of ischemic complications in unstable angina and in non Q-wave myocardial infarction; it is indicated in conjunction with percutaneous intervention and/or other treatment for the management of acute ST elevation myocardial infarction.[L31393]

Enoxaparin is also indicated in the prophylaxis of DVT in abdominal surgery, hip replacement, knee replacement, or medical patients with severely restricted mobility during acute illness. Additionally, enoxaparin is indicated for the inpatient treatment of DVT with or without pulmonary embolism and the treatment of outpatient DVT without pulmonary embolism.[L31393]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
