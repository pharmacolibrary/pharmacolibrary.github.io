<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The sapropterin (BH4) model was rejected because the absorption rate constant kabs (0.235) was reported without a usable unit (given only as 'units'), so it could not be expressed in reciprocal hours and failed the dimensional check on a structural parameter.**

The record for sapropterin in infants, young children and adults with phenylketonuria lists kabs, the absorption rate constant, with value 0.235 and unit 'units' rather than a reciprocal-time unit such as 1/h. Without a proper unit the value could not be converted to a consistent time base, so the dimensional consistency check on this structural parameter failed. The other parameters carry coherent units (CL/F 2710 L/h, V/F 3010 L, tlag 0.321 h, C0 16.6 μg/L), so the failure is confined to kabs. Extracted — sapropterin (BH4): CL/F 2.71e+03 L/h, V/F 3.01e+03 L, kabs 0.235 units, tlag 0.321 h, C0 16.6 μg/L.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'k a h-1' → Q49 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '1 / [time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'C0 (μg/L)' → Q86 (unit '[mass] / [length] ** 3' vs ontology '[mass] * [time] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=sapropterin (BH4)
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- 1C volume normalization: Q290→Q76 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'Vc/F (L)' is the general volume)
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
