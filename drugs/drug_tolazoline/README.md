## About

**Description.** A vasodilator that apparently has direct actions on blood vessels and also increases cardiac output. Tolazoline can interact to some degree with histamine, adrenergic, and cholinergic receptors, but the mechanisms of its therapeutic effects are not clear. It is used in treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.

**Indication.** For the treatment of pulmonary artery anomalies

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| PD | Dunne_1991 | not_relevant | 3 | 2 | The paper reports a qualitative observation that tolazoline blocks K+ATP channels at 25 microM, but provides no numeric PD parameters (like Ki or IC50) or dose-response curve for tolazoline, unlike the detailed analysis provided for phentolamine. |
| popPK | Fuder_1986 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a pharmacological investigation of receptor affinity and efficacy in perfused rat hearts, not a pharmacokinetic study, and reports no disposition parameters for tolazoline. |

| PD | Ishikawa_1996 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the pharmacology of isothiocyanatobenzyl imidazoline (IBI) and only qualitatively mentions tolazoline as a parent molecule without providing any PD data or parameters for tolazoline. |

| popPK | Rogers_1994 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a pharmacodynamic investigation of vascular resistance in an ex vivo model, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting disposition parameters for tolazoline. |
| popPK | Williams_1993 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine, with tolazoline used only as a co-administered vasoactive agent to modulate skin perfusion, not as the subject drug for PK parameter estimation. |
| PGx | Yan_2017 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports tolazoline as an inhibitor of CYP4Z1 in a recombinant yeast system, not a pharmacogenomic effect on tolazoline's PK/PD parameters. |
