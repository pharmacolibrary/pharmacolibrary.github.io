## About

**Description.** Sodium tartrate is a disodium salt of l-( + )-tartaric acid that is identified by transparent, colorless, and odorless crystals. It is obtained as a byproduct of wine manufacturing. Sodium tartrate is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as a direct human food ingredient. It acts as an emulsifier and pH control agent in food products [L2590].

This compound is commonly used as an emulsifier in cheese/cheese spread products and is not to exceed 4% concentration, according to Health Canada regulations [L2594].

**Indication.** It acts as an emulsifier and pH control agent in food products [L2590], [L2598].
In the laboratory, it is used while performing the Karl Fischer equation, which is used to determine the water content of various substances [F18], [L2590].

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
