<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Billo_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro mechanistic study analyzing transporter inhibition (IC50) and cross-reactivity, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting disposition parameters like clearance or volume. |
| popPK | Carreño_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on linerixibat, not elobixibat, and models the pharmacodynamics of a biomarker (C4) rather than the pharmacokinetics of the subject drug. |
| popPK | Chedid_2018 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a narrative review of elobixibat's mechanism and clinical efficacy for constipation, containing no quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, ka, etc.). |
| PD | Chedid_2018 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The text is a narrative review summarizing clinical efficacy and mechanism of action but does not report specific numeric PD parameters (e.g., EC50, Emax) or quantitative exposure-response data. |

| PGx | Michiba_2025 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on characterizing intestinal transporters in cell models for general drug absorption prediction and does not report pharmacogenomic effects on elobixibat PK/PD. |
| popPK | Wong_2013 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is a review of clinical efficacy and mechanism of action, lacking original quantitative pharmacokinetic parameter values (CL, V, etc.) for elobixibat. |
| PD | Wong_2013 | not_relevant | 2 | 0 | The text is a qualitative review/overview of Phase II trials and mechanism of action, containing no numeric PD parameters, dose-response curves, or PK/PD model fits. |
| popPK | Zhang_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a pharmacodynamic meta-analysis focusing on bowel movement frequency, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting disposition parameters for elobixibat. |
| PD | Zhang_2020 | not_relevant | 3 | 2 | The paper is a model-based meta-analysis that reports aggregate effect sizes (maximal increase in bowel movements) for elobixibat, but it does not provide specific numeric PD parameters (like Emax, EC50) or an exposure-response curve for elobixibat in the provided text. |
| popPK | Zinsmeister_2013 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a statistical analysis of pharmacodynamic and clinical endpoints (colonic transit, stool frequency) and does not report pharmacokinetic parameters for elobixibat. |
| PD | Zinsmeister_2013 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is a statistical review of coefficients of variation for endpoints in Phase IIA trials; it does not report specific concentration-effect or dose-response data or numeric PD parameters for elobixibat. |
