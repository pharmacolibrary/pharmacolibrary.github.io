## About

Etilefrine is a sympathomimetic drug that acts on alpha- and beta-1 adrenergic receptors and was used as a cardiotonic and vasoconstrictor, mainly to raise blood pressure in low blood pressure conditions. It has been approved in some countries but is listed as withdrawn, so it is no longer in general use.

<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| PD | Coleman_1975 | not_relevant | 3 | 2 | The text provides only qualitative descriptions of dose-dependent effects (e.g., PVR falls at 1-8 mg, rises at higher doses) without reporting specific numeric PD parameters (Emax, EC50) or quantitative concentration-effect curves. |
| PD | Hassen_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports only pharmacokinetic parameters (bioavailability comparison) and in vitro dissolution/texture data; it does not measure any pharmacodynamic effect or report exposure-response/dose-response relationships. |

| PD | Onishi_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses exclusively on pharmacokinetic absorption and bioavailability after buccal administration, reporting no pharmacodynamic effects or exposure-response relationships. |
| PD | Onishi_2021 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the formulation and pharmacokinetics (plasma concentration-time profile) of etilefrine films, reporting no pharmacodynamic or exposure-response relationship. |
| PD | Otaif_2023 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes an electrochemical analytical method for detecting etilefrine concentration, not a pharmacodynamic or exposure-response study. |
| PD | Raviele_1999 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical efficacy trial reporting binary outcomes (syncope recurrence) and does not contain any pharmacokinetic data, concentration-effect analysis, or numeric PD parameters. |
| PD | Sakata_2020 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the formulation and pharmacokinetics (absorption/plasma levels) of etilefrine buccal tablets, but does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response analysis with numeric PD parameters. |
| PGx | Zhang_2019 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes the chemical synthesis of metabolites for future analytical studies and does not report any pharmacogenomic effects on PK or PD parameters. |
