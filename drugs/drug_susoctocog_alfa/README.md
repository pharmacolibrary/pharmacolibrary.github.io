## About

Susoctocog alfa is a porcine recombinant form of antihemophilic factor (factor VIII), a blood coagulation factor used to treat bleeding in clotting factor deficiency. It is an approved medicine, listed for blood coagulation disorders, though its exact authorised regions are not specified in the available facts.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
