A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The propafenone two-compartment record was rejected because a structural parameter has a dimension mismatch and the model structure contains an unreachable compartment, with all five parameter values (t1/2α 2.8 min, t1/2β 80 min, kel 0.12 min⁻¹, Vdβ 1.6 l/kg, CL 1.03 l/h) disputed by a second reader.**

The record was built from the paper's abstract only, so reported summary statistics stood in for a fitted model. A dimension mismatch was flagged on a structural parameter, and the model structure contains an unreachable compartment with no path from the dose. A second reader returned no value for any of the five parameters — kel 0.12 min⁻¹, CL 1.03 l/h, t1/2α 2.8 min, t1/2β 80 min and Vdβ 1.6 l/kg — disagreeing with all of them. Extracted — propafenone: t1/2α 2.8 min, t1/2β 80 min, kel 0.12 min, -1, V2 1.6 1/kg, CL 1.03 1/h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of cl: this record has 1.03, the second reading none; it also differs on 4 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'min, -1' (kel)
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Vd beta' → Q64 (unit 'dimensionless' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Cl' → Q22 (unit '1 / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'AUR' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Arboix_1985:abstract'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=propafenone
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Arboix_1985_metadata.yaml (6 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
