**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The tranexamic acid two-compartment model for pregnant individuals was rejected because a compartment has no path from the dose, making part of the structure unreachable.**

The record contains blood clearance CLb of 8.59, central volume V1 of 10.7, inter-compartmental blood flow Qb of 28.9, peripheral volume V2 of 15.0, and an oral absorption lag time of 0.16, with weight covariate effects of 0.89 on clearance and flow and 0.44 on the volumes. The rejection reason is an unreachable or orphan compartment or unlinked metabolite in the topology. A second reader also disagreed on several fields: it read an oral absorption rate constant of 0.18 and an oral bioavailability fraction of 0.56 where this record has no values, and it assigned linear-fractional covariate forms to the clearance and volume parameters where this record lists them differently or not at all. Extracted — tranexamic acid: CLb 8.59, V1 10.7, Qb 28.9, V2 15, tlag 0.16.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has tranexamic acid, the second reading tranexamic_acid; it also differs on 7 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

- covariate level 'Weight on Vc and Vp' → Q900:weight_on_vc_and_vp = 0.44 (linear_fractional on Q23)

- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q63 (Vc b); Q64 (Vp b)
