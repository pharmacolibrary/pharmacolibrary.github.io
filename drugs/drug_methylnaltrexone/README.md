- **ATC codes:** `A06AH01`
- **DrugBank:** [DB06800](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB06800) · **PubChem:** not captured
- **groups:** approved, investigational

## About

**Description.** Methylnaltrexone is a pheriphally-acting μ-opioid antagonist that acts on the gastrointestinal tract to decrease opioid-induced constipation without producing analgesic effects or withdrawal symptoms. It is also a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor. FDA approved in 2008.

**Indication.** Treatment of opioids induced constipation in palliative patients that are inadequately responding to laxative therapy.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
