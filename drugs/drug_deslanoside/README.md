## About

Deslanoside is a digitalis glycoside used to treat atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, and congestive heart failure. It is an approved medicine, though it appears to be little used today and is not authorised in the European Union.

<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Abady_2024 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes a bioanalytical method validation for quantifying deslanoside in dried blood spots and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, t1/2, etc.). |
| popPK | Gao_2012 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the effects of ethanol on arrhythmia using deslanoside as an inducing agent, not as the subject of a pharmacokinetic analysis, and reports no PK parameters. |
| PD | Gao_2012 | not_relevant | 3 | 2 | The paper reports qualitative dose-response effects of ethanol on deslanoside-induced arrhythmia (increased cumulative dosage required) but does not provide numeric PD parameters (e.g., EC50, Emax) or a concentration-effect curve for deslanoside itself. |
| popPK | Goldsmith_1992 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the effect of deslanoside on norepinephrine kinetics, not the pharmacokinetic parameters of deslanoside itself. |
| popPK | Gökçe_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in vitro/in silico investigation of enzyme inhibition (PON1) and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters for deslanoside. |
| PD | Gökçe_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study reports in vitro enzyme inhibition (IC50) of PON1 by deslanoside, which is a pharmacological mechanism study, not a pharmacodynamic exposure-response or dose-response relationship for the drug's clinical effect. |
| popPK | Huang_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study analyzes factors influencing serum digoxin concentrations and lists deslanoside only as a concomitant medication variable, without reporting any pharmacokinetic parameters for deslanoside. |
| PD | Huang_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study analyzes factors influencing serum digoxin concentration (PK) using logistic regression, not the pharmacodynamic effect of deslanoside or digoxin; no exposure-response or dose-response relationship for a drug effect is reported. |
| popPK | Li_2015 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on digoxin pharmacokinetics in rats, with deslanoside only mentioned as a compound tested for method optimization, not as the subject of PK analysis. |
| popPK | Marzo_1982 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | no_text gate: only 78 chars of text extracted (&lt; 400) |
| popPK | Tada_1982 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The provided evidence contains only software metadata and no scientific content regarding deslanoside pharmacokinetics. |
