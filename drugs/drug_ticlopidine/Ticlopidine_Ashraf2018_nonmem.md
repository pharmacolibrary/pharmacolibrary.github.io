<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The ticlopidine record (Ashraf_2018, S-ketamine measured, parent–metabolite structure with S-ketamine to norketamine) was rejected because a structural parameter failed a dimension check, and a reported unit could not be converted to SI.**

The model carries CLint of 301 L/h, volume of distribution V of 14.4 L, and intercompartmental clearance Q of 287 L/h, linked by the metabolism rate constant Kfm from S-ketamine to norketamine. The rejection reason is a dimension mismatch on a structural parameter. One reported unit could not be expressed in SI units, so that parameter arrived at the model builder without a usable numeric value; the findings do not identify which of the three parameters was affected. Extracted — ticlopidine: CLint 301 L/h, V 14.4 L, Q 287 L/h.

**Model structure:** parent + metabolite; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 3 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.
