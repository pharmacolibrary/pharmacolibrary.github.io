## About

**Description.** Refractory anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III) and Glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) are primary malignant brain tumours with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Despite considerable genetic heterogeneity, these tumours often have impaired DNA repair systems, rendering them initially sensitive to alkylating agents, although they invariably develop resistance to these agents over time.[A229848, A229858, L32033] Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine prodrug that is stable at acidic pH but undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic hydrolysis at neutral or slightly basic pH; these properties allow for both oral and intravenous administration.[A229853, A229888, A229923, L32033] Following initial hydrolysis, further reactions liberate a highly reactive methyl diazonium cation capable of methylating various residues on adenosine and guanine bases leading to DNA lesions and eventual apoptosis.[A229853, A229923] Temozomolide as an adjunct to radiotherapy followed by maintenance dosing remains the standard of care for both Glioblastoma and refractory anaplastic astrocytoma.[L32033]

Temozolomide was granted FDA approval on August 11, 1999, as an oral capsule and subsequently on February 27, 2009, as an intravenous injection. It is currently marketed under the trademark TEMODAR® by Merck.[L32033]

**Indication.** Temozolomide is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma concomitantly with radiotherapy and for use as maintenance treatment thereafter. It is also indicated for the treatment of refractory anaplastic astrocytoma in adult patients or adjuvant therapy for adults with newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma.[L48265]

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

| PD | Singh_2019 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the pharmacokinetics and exposure-response of veliparib, not temozolomide, and does not report PD parameters for temozolomide. |
| PGx | Song_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the pharmacokinetics of olaparib, not temozolomide. |
| PGx | Stepanenko_2016 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates chromosomal instability and phenotypic changes in glioblastoma cell lines induced by temozolomide, but does not report pharmacogenomic effects of specific gene variants on PK or PD parameters. |
| popPK | Tavener_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the cytotoxicity of anthracyclines (doxorubicin, etc.) in glioma cells, with temozolomide mentioned only as a standard therapy comparator and no PK parameters reported. |
| PD | Tavener_2021 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the dose-response relationship of anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin), not temozolomide. |
| PGx | Tiek_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes in vitro cell line models of acquired resistance to temozolomide and characterizes phenotypic changes (proliferation, migration, metabolism) but does not report pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants/genotypes) on PK or PD parameters in humans. |
| PGx | Velpula_2017 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates a metabolic inhibitor (DCA) to reverse temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma but does not report any pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants) on temozolomide's PK or PD parameters. |
| popPK | Wood_2022 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The paper is a computational modeling study using temozolomide as an example drug, but it does not report original quantitative PK parameters (CL, V, etc.) for temozolomide, and no numeric values are present in the evidence. |
| PGx | Yamashita_2019 | not_relevant | 2 | 5 | The paper compares diagnostic assays (MS-HRM vs MS-PCR) for detecting MGMT methylation status and their correlation with survival outcomes, but does not report pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters of temozolomide. |
| PGx | Zhang_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the mechanism of temozolomide resistance via the ROCK2/ABCG2 pathway and the effect of the inhibitor fasudil, but it does not report a pharmacogenomic effect (gene variant/genotype) on a PK or PD parameter. |
| PGx | de_2018_2 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies the pharmacokinetics of the PARP inhibitor AZD2461, not temozolomide, and does not report pharmacogenomic effects on temozolomide. |
| PGx | de_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the MPS1 inhibitor NTRC 0066-0, not the pharmacogenomics of temozolomide. |
