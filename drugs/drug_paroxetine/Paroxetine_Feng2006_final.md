**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The paroxetine record (Feng_2006, elderly subjects) was rejected because a structural parameter was reported in a unit that could not be converted to SI, giving a dimension mismatch on that parameter.**

One parameter of the paroxetine three-compartment model was reported in a unit that could not be expressed in SI, so the parameter arrived without a usable value and the dimension check on a structural parameter failed. The fitted parameters themselves are Vmax 32.5 µg h⁻¹, Km 83.4 µg l⁻¹, V2 6.70 l, V3 102.1 l, Q 12.3 l h⁻¹, kabs 8.8 h⁻¹ and Vd/F 1010.0 L. A second reader also disagreed on several covariate-effect values, reading theta_q61_im as 182 and theta_q61_pm as 125 where this record lists theta_q367_im 182, theta_q367_um 3670, theta_vmax_pm 125 and theta_vmax_um as absent. Extracted — paroxetine: Vmax 32.5 µg h -1, Km 83.4 µg l -1, V2 6.7 l, V3 102 l, Q 12.3 l h -1, kabs 8.8 h -1, V 1.01e+03 L.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has paroxetine, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 11 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'V m (µg h -1 )' → Q66 (unit '[mass] / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Wt (θ V2 )' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_4:row12:col4', 'tab_4:row12:col5'])
- dropped value-less row: 'Wt, total body weight'
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q64 (V 2 (l)); Q30 (Q (l h -1 ))
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=paroxetine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- model-stage split: 'final model' is the final model of Feng_2006 (paper reports 2 stages: base model, final model); same population, different model-building step
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
