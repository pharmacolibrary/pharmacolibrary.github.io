A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The exenatide record was rejected because a structural parameter failed a dimension check — the total clearance is reported as 12.3 L/h while the other rate parameters (kabs 2.98 1/day, Q 89.3 L/day, CLint 110 L/day) use per-day units, giving an inconsistent dimension.**

The model is a two-compartment structure for exenatide in type 2 diabetes patients with transit-compartment absorption (ktr 0.0872 1/day) and Michaelis-Menten elimination (Vmax 0.037 mg/day, Km 567 pg/mL). The clearance parameter carries the unit L/h, which could not be converted to a consistent per-day scale, so the parameter entered the model without a value on the same time basis as the other parameters and the dimension check on the structural parameter failed. A second reader also disagreed on several extracted values, reading 2.4 where this record has no value, and leaving null where this record lists 567, 110, 0.0872, 7.03 and 0.037. Extracted — exenatide: kabs 2.98, CLint 110 L/day, V 7.03 L, Fab 1.13, ktr 0.0872, Km 567 pg/mL, Vmax 0.037 mg/day, Q 89.3 L/day, … (+2).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has exenatide, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 4 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'CLint (L/day)' → Q3 (unit '[length] ** 3 / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time] / [mass]') — route to review
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'f2 (%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Cirincione_2017_table_p6_1:row4:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'f3 (%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Cirincione_2017_table_p6_1:row5:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'fret(single-dose study) (%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Cirincione_2017_table_p6_1:row6:col1'])
- dropped duplicate Q306 ('ktr2 (1/day)', value '0.667') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'N1' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Cirincione_2017_table_p6_1:row10:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'N2' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Cirincione_2017_table_p6_1:row11:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Vctwkg' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Cirincione_2017_table_p6_1:row12:col1'])
- covariate level 'CL eGFR' → Q900:cl_egfr = 0.838 (power on Q3)
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Vmax (mg/day)' → Q66 (unit '[mass] / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'RVS D study (Log SD)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Cirincione_2017_table_p6_1:row18:col1'])
- implicit units: 'ka (1/day)' → 1/day (from the paper text: "The parameter is explicitly listed in the input as 'ka (1/day) = 2.98'. Additionally, the context of exenatide extended-")
- implicit units: 'ktr1 (1/day)' → 1/day (from the paper text: "The parameter is explicitly listed in the input as 'ktr1 (1/day) = 0.0872'. The magnitude (0.0872) is consistent with a ")
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=exenatide
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'single-dose model parameter estimate' subgroup of Cirincione_2017 (paper reports 2 populations: combined single- and multiple-dose models parameter estimate, single-dose model parameter estimate)
- gap-filled Q22 (CL) from Admiraal_2023's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
