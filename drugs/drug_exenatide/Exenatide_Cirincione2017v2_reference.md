**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The exenatide record was held back because the absorption rate constant ka was not reported in the source and a placeholder value was substituted, alongside unreported lag time and an assumed F=1 apparent parameterization.**

The source reports only CL/F (9.1 l/h) and V (7.04 l) for exenatide; no absorption rate constant or lag time was extracted, so library placeholder values were used in their place, and the invented ka was flagged as not acceptable. The model was built with an apparent parameterization assuming F=1 and Fm=1 without molar correction, using first-order depot input for extravascular dosing. A second reader also disagreed on several extracted values, e.g. reading 1.35 and 96 where this record had none, and 100 where this record had 1. Extracted — exenatide: CL/F 9.1 l h−1, V 7.04 l.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has exenatide, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 4 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<summary>Check legend — what each column means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>check</code></td><td>the check id. C0_has_structural_params = at least one numeric structural parameter; C0b_disposition_core = a volume OR a clearance/elimination term (neither means an exposure/outcome paper, not popPK — rejected); C0c_disposition_complete = BOTH a volume AND a clearance/elimination term, which is what the engineer needs to build (one without the other routes to review, never to the engineer); C1_half_life(_beta) = reported half-life against V and CL; C2_reference = covariate scenarios are sign-plausible; C3_cl_dose_auc = CL against dose/AUC; C4_auc_closed_form = AUC recomputed in closed form; C5_dimension_&lt;Qcode&gt; = the parameter's units carry the dimension its Q-code requires.</td></tr><tr><td><code>status</code></td><td>pass, fail, or skipped. A skipped check had nothing to compare — the paper did not report the input it needs — and is not evidence against the record. The scholar table lists only pass and fail; the reviewer table also shows skipped, with the reason in note.</td></tr><tr><td><code>expected</code></td><td>the value the check required, from the paper or from the ontology.</td></tr><tr><td><code>obtained</code></td><td>what the record actually yields.</td></tr><tr><td><code>ratio</code></td><td>obtained / expected, where the check is a numeric comparison.</td></tr><tr><td><code>tol</code></td><td>the tolerance the ratio had to fall within to pass.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>the artifact the expected value was taken from.</td></tr><tr><td><code>scenario</code></td><td>reviewer table only — the covariate scenario the check was run under.</td></tr><tr><td><code>note</code></td><td>why a check was skipped, or how it was judged.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>No downloads: this record is <b>rejected</b>, so it is not published as a model. Any archives generated for it before the verdict have been removed — a download outlives the page that explains it.</p>

_No web simulator for this record: its structure has no shared WebAssembly template. The FMI archive under **Models** carries its own compiled FMU._
