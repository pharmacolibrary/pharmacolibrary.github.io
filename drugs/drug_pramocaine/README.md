## About

**Description.** Pramocaine (also known as pramoxine or pramoxine HCI) is a topical anesthetic and antipruritic. It is used for many dermatological and anorectal/anogenital conditions including minor cuts/burns, insect bites, hives/rashes due to poison ivy exposure, hemorrhoids and other anorectal/anogenital disorders.  Pramocaine is available by itself and in combination with other medications in various topical preparations. It works by preventing ionic fluctuations needed for neuron membrane depolarization and action potential propagation.

**Indication.** It is indicated for  temporary relief of pain and pruritus from minor lip and skin irritations as well as for temporary relief from pain, burning, itching and discomfort associated with hemorrhoids and other anorectal/anogenital disorders.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Hirao_2018 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the electrophysiological effects of antidepressants on frog sciatic nerve action potentials and does not report pharmacokinetic parameters for pramocaine. |
| PD | Hirao_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the effects of antidepressants on nerve conduction and only mentions pramoxine (a different compound) as a comparator; it does not report any pharmacodynamic data or parameters for pramocaine. |
| popPK | Magori_2019 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the mechanism of nerve conduction inhibition by propofol in frog sciatic nerves, and pramocaine is not the subject drug (pramoxine is mentioned as a comparator, but no PK parameters are reported). |
| PD | Magori_2019 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on propofol and its analogs; pramocaine is not mentioned, and no PD parameters for it are reported. |
| popPK | Pinarbasli_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in vitro release and formulation analysis for pramoxine (not pramocaine) and does not report pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| PD | Pinarbasli_2025 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on in vitro release and formulation stability, not pharmacodynamic or exposure-response relationships. |
| popPK | Weinberger_1980 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes an analytical method (HPLC) for pramoxine (a different drug) and contains no pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| PD | Weinberger_1980 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes an HPLC analytical method for pramoxine and contains no pharmacodynamic or exposure-response data. |
