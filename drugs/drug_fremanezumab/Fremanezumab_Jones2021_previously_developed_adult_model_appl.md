**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**The fremanezumab pediatric model was held back because the absorption rate constant ka was not reported in the source and a placeholder value was substituted, an invented absorption deemed not acceptable.**

The record's ka (absorption rate constant) has no source value; a library default was used in its place, and this invented absorption was judged not acceptable. In addition, the record defines weight-based covariate effects (theta_q319_weight_power, values 1.05 and 1.53), but only the reference individual was simulated, so those covariate scenarios were not exercised. A second reader also recorded a bioavailability (f1) of 0.658 where this record has none. Extracted — fremanezumab: CL 0.0902 L/day, V1 1.88 L, kabs 0.18, Q 0.262 L/day, V2 1.72 L, tlag 0.0803 day.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of f1: bioavailability: this record has none, the second reading 0.658. That field does not shape the model.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- covariate effect for Q319 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=fremanezumab
- population split: 'previously developed adult model applied to pediatric data' subgroup of Jones_2021 (paper reports 2 populations: pediatric model to support phase 3 development 1, previously developed adult model applied to pediatric data)

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 1
- skipped illustrative/example figure caption(s) pharmaceutics-13-00785-f001 — per-individual fit, not model parameters
