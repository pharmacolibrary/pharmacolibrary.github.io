<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section residual_error: 'σ (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability')
- table section residual_error: 'σ Sedation (mm)' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability')
- table section residual_error: 'σ Cognitive function (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability')
- routed 'θ4' → Q314 (omega_cov) to covariance — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θ5' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab3:row10:col1', 'Tab3:row10:col2'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Keo (1/hr)' → Q326 (ke0, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Tab3:row15:col1', 'Tab3:row15:col2'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Sedation constant' → Q326 (ke0, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Tab3:row16:col1', 'Tab3:row16:col2'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Cognitive function constant' → Q324 (E0, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Tab3:row17:col1', 'Tab3:row17:col2'])
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number 12.1 (source ['Tab3:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number -11.0 (source ['Tab3:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- covariate effect for Q61 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- covariate effect for Q22 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- implicit units: 'θ1 (1/hr)' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'No unit stated in caption or text; kel is a first-order elimination rate constant, conventionally in 1/h, consistent wit')
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q64 (θ2 (L))
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=triazolam
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- bound model equation to Q61 (V): Vd = θ2* (age/30)^θ4
- bound model equation to Q22 (CL): CL = θ3 * (age/30)^θ5 * 1/AUCR
- Q61 (V) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'Vd'; equation kept verbatim
- Q22 (CL) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'CL'; equation kept verbatim
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 3
- captured model equation Vd = θ2* (age/30)^θ4
- captured model equation CL = θ3 * (age/30)^θ5 * 1/AUCR
