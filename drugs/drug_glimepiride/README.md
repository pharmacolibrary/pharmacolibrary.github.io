## About

**Description.** First introduced in 1995, glimepiride is a member of the second-generation sulfonylurea (SU) drug class used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic control. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalences worldwide; it is characterized by insulin resistance in accordance with progressive β cell failure and long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications that lead to co-morbidities and mortalities. Sulfonylureas are one of the insulin secretagogues widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes to lower blood glucose levels. The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic β-cells are present,[A177715] as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake.[A177709] 

Glimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K<SUB>ATP</SUB> channels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to [glipizide], another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action. It is sometimes classified as a third-generation SU because it has larger substitutions than other second-generation SUs.[A177703] Compared to other SUs, glimepiride was associated with a lower risk of developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in clinical trials [A177709] as well as fewer cardiovascular effects than other SUs due to minimal effects on ischemic preconditioning of cardiac myocytes.[A177703] It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is considered to be a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.[A177703] Glimepiride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1995 for the treatment of T2DM. It is commo

**Indication.** Glimepiride is indicated for the management of type 2 diabetes in adults as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control as monotherapy. 

It may also be indicated for use in combination with metformin or insulin to lower blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes whose high blood sugar levels cannot be controlled by diet and exercise in conjunction with an oral hypoglycemic (a drug used to lower blood sugar levels) agent alone.[L10322]
