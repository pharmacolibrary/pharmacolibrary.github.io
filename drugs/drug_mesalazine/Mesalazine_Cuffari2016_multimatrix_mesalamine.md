**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The mesalazine (5-ASA) model was rejected because its structure is a one-compartment parent model instead of the paper's parent–metabolite structure, its output is the parent rather than the measured 5-ASA compartment, and its simulated tmax (0.183 h) misses the paper's values (2–9 h).**

The record claims a parent–metabolite structure with Ac-5-ASA formed from 5-ASA, but the model was built as a single one-compartment parent model, so the metabolite compartment is absent from the structure. The model's output is the parent central compartment rather than the measured 5-ASA compartment. Simulated as the paper dosed it, the model's time of the peak (tmax) is 0.183 h against paper values of 2, 6, 7.5 and 9 h (ratios 0.0306–0.0917), exceeding the tolerance. Parameter values (apparent metabolic clearance 85.6 L/h, central volume 109 L) were read by only one reader, with the second reader leaving them null. Extracted — mesalazine: CL 85.6 L/h, V1 109 L.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has mesalazine, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 5 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by glm-5.3-flash</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `mesalazine`, measured `5-ASA`.

- table mostly unlinked (8/8 table-cell rows NIL) — likely the wrong table was located, not 0 genuinely-missing ontology parameter(s); route_to_review instead of building a model from the residual linked cell(s)
- salvaged Q22 ('apparent metabolic clearance'=85.6) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q63 ('central volume of distribution'=109) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable

- template fit: PK_3M_9C — formed from central; parent 1, metabolites [0]

- population split: 'multimatrix mesalamine' subgroup of Cuffari_2016 (paper reports 2 populations: multimatrix mesalamine, nonmem estimates)

- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 40/40 row label(s) assigned, 60 linked by role; re-tagged parent→5-ASA ×132, parent→Ac-5-ASA ×52
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- engineer: parent → metabolite not buildable on PK_3M_9C (None) — the measured compound's 1-compartment model instead

<sub>Runs this record's model in the browser as WebAssembly. Sliders start at the extracted values; the reference check compares the browser's peak against the FMPy result recorded when the record was built, and is withheld once a value has been edited. Template `PK_1C` · parameters `Mesalazine_Cuffari2016_multimatrix_mesalamine_params.json` · controls `Mesalazine_Cuffari2016_multimatrix_mesalamine_sim_controls.json`. A slider marked *simulator value* is running on the template's own default because this record does not pin that parameter.</sub>
