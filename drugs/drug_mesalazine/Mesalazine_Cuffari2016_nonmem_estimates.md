<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**The mesalazine parent–metabolite model was quarantined because total clearance (Cl) and absorption lag time (Tlag) had no values in the source and were left at library placeholder defaults.**

The record defines apparent parameters for 5-ASA (CLR/F 1.01 L/h, CLm/F 75.9 L/h, V1/F 70.1 L, V/F 5.31 L, kabs 0.0207 h−1, Fab 0.413), but mesalazine's clearance and absorption lag time were missing, so placeholder values stood in and the model was held back rather than published with invented numbers. The model structure also mismatched: a parent–metabolite topology was expected but a one-compartment enteral structure was obtained. Additionally, the weight-based covariate effects (e.g., 0.75 exponents on clearance and 1 on volume) were defined but never exercised in simulation — only the reference individual was simulated — and the builder assumed F=1, Fm=1 with no molar correction, so all parameters are apparent. A second reader could not confirm the reported 22.1% mean dose absorbed. Extracted — mesalazine: CLR 1.01 L/h, CLm/F 75.9 L/h, V1/F 70.1 L, CLnorm/F 66.7 L/h, V/F 5.31 L, kabs 0.0207 h−1, Fab 0.413.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of % dose absorbed, mean: this record has 22.1, the second reading none. That field does not shape the model.

**Model structure:** 1-compartment, oral mammillary model — template `PK_1C_enteral`.  
**Parameters:** 7 extracted, plus 6 covariate effects.

**Parameterization:** CLm/F, CLnorm/F, V/F, V1/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `model_quarantined`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

**Reviewer per-scenario checks:**

| check | scenario | status | expected | obtained | ratio | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T2_covariates_not_exercised | (all) | fail | not captured | not captured | not captured | record has covariate_effects but the engineer simulated only the reference individual — covariate scenarios were not exercised |
| T0_analyte_identity | not captured | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | V/CL labels are the drug's (or a metabolite's), no biomarker signal |
| T3_apparent_invariant | not captured | pass | not captured | F=Fm=1, no molar correction | not captured | apparent params must not be double-corrected |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | pass | 3 scholar param(s) emitted or defaulted | 3 covered | not captured | all structural parameters accounted for |
| T3_rate_constant_conversion | not captured | pass | Kfm (rate_constant) → CL = k·V | no explicit k·V edge found in model | not captured | rate constant must not be used raw as a clearance |
| T3_topology_template | not captured | fail | parent_metabolite → PK_3M_9C* | PK_1C_enteral | not captured | engineer template must match the scholar topology |

<summary>Check legend — what each column means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>check</code></td><td>the check id. C0_has_structural_params = at least one numeric structural parameter; C0b_disposition_core = a volume OR a clearance/elimination term (neither means an exposure/outcome paper, not popPK — rejected); C0c_disposition_complete = BOTH a volume AND a clearance/elimination term, which is what the engineer needs to build (one without the other routes to review, never to the engineer); C1_half_life(_beta) = reported half-life against V and CL; C2_reference = covariate scenarios are sign-plausible; C3_cl_dose_auc = CL against dose/AUC; C4_auc_closed_form = AUC recomputed in closed form; C5_dimension_&lt;Qcode&gt; = the parameter's units carry the dimension its Q-code requires.</td></tr><tr><td><code>status</code></td><td>pass, fail, or skipped. A skipped check had nothing to compare — the paper did not report the input it needs — and is not evidence against the record. The scholar table lists only pass and fail; the reviewer table also shows skipped, with the reason in note.</td></tr><tr><td><code>expected</code></td><td>the value the check required, from the paper or from the ontology.</td></tr><tr><td><code>obtained</code></td><td>what the record actually yields.</td></tr><tr><td><code>ratio</code></td><td>obtained / expected, where the check is a numeric comparison.</td></tr><tr><td><code>tol</code></td><td>the tolerance the ratio had to fall within to pass.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>the artifact the expected value was taken from.</td></tr><tr><td><code>scenario</code></td><td>reviewer table only — the covariate scenario the check was run under.</td></tr><tr><td><code>note</code></td><td>why a check was skipped, or how it was judged.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>
