## About

**Description.** An anti-inflammatory agent, structurally related to the salicylates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like acetylsalicylic acid, which is active in inflammatory bowel disease [A174022]. Although demonstrably effective in treating and maintaining remission for ulcerative colitis, mesalazine has historically faced a number of issues regarding its lack of stability as a pharmaceutical agent [A174019]. Throughout the late seventies and the eighties, important research initiatives developed stable mesalazine formulations like the eudragit-S coating of Asacol brand mesalazine and the Pentasa brand's encapsulation of mesalazine within microgranules [A174019]. In the present day, contemporary research regarding novel methods to stabilize mesalazine continues and interest in the agent's capacity to decrease inflammatory activity and subsequently potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in conditions like ulcerative colitis is maintained.[A174019,A174022]

**Indication.** Mesalazine is indicated for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults and patients 5 years or older.[L36280,L36275]. Mesalazine is also indicated for the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults and maintenance of remission of Crohn's ileocolitis.[L44196,L5101]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
