## About

Desipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant used for depression and has also been used for pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance use disorder, and neurotic disorders. It remains an approved medicine, though it carries a boxed warning and is used less often than newer antidepressants.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
