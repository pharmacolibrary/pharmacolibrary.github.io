<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label (paper)</code></td><td>the row or statistic label exactly as printed in the paper (label_verbatim) — never normalised, so it can be found in the PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Q-code · name</code></td><td>the ontology parameter this label was matched to (Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F, Q49 = ka, Q57 = half-life, …) and its canonical name. The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—(suppressed)</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state, so its numbers are withheld.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q32 ('C max SC', value '13.1') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q56 ('T maxSC', value '1') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q17 ('AUC0‐ꚙPO', value '18.8') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q17 ('AUC0‐ꚙSC', value '48.8') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q47 ('k ePO', value '0.52') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q47 ('k eSC', value '0.28') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('t 1/2zPO', value '1.3') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('t 1/2zSC', value '2.6') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=amoxicillin
- population split: 'cat 5' subgroup of Dubbelboer_2025 (paper reports 8 populations: cat 1, cat 2, cat 3, cat 4, cat 5, cat 6, median, typical value)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Baklouti_2026's review values (primary lacked it)
- gap-filled Q83 (tlag) from Dubbelboer_2025's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- companion parameter table 1 transcribed (103 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 1, 2

## Validation

**Scholar closed-form checks:**

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| C0b_disposition_core | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C5_dimension_Q49 | pass | 1 / [time] | not captured | not captured | not captured | ['Baklouti_2026:review'] |
| C5_dimension_Q83 | pass | [time] | not captured | not captured | not captured | ['Dubbelboer_2025:review'] |

<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>check</code></td><td>the check id. C0_has_structural_params = at least one numeric structural parameter; C0b_disposition_core = a volume OR a clearance/elimination term (neither means an exposure/outcome paper, not popPK — rejected); C0c_disposition_complete = BOTH a volume AND a clearance/elimination term, which is what the engineer needs to build (one without the other routes to review, never to the engineer); C1_half_life(_beta) = reported half-life against V and CL; C2_reference = covariate scenarios are sign-plausible; C3_cl_dose_auc = CL against dose/AUC; C4_auc_closed_form = AUC recomputed in closed form; C5_dimension_&lt;Qcode&gt; = the parameter's units carry the dimension its Q-code requires.</td></tr><tr><td><code>status</code></td><td>pass, fail, or skipped. A skipped check had nothing to compare — the paper did not report the input it needs — and is not evidence against the record.
