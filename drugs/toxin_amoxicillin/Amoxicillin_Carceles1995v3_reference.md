## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Ca' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row2:col4'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'B' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row4:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'B' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row4:col4'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): '13' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row5:col4'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 't, 2/5' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row7:col4'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ka`(b)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row12:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 't I ,2a,' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row13:col4'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'A' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Carceles_1995_3_table_1:row1:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): '1(12' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Carceles_1995_3_table_1:row6:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'tina' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Carceles_1995_3_table_1:row11:col2'])
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q22 (CL)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=amoxicillin
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- gap-filled Q61 (V) from Bardhi_2026's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
