### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge; the engineer did not exercise the covariate scenarios this record defines. Evidence: T2_covariates_not_exercised

**Steps:**
1. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.
2. Advisory only — the base model still replicates.
3. Check the record's covariate_definitions in _interpretv2.yaml.
4. Re-run the engineer for this drug if the covariate curves are wanted.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `not_modelled` (reviewed 2026-09-11 08:46:40.377693+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-09-16 16:40:26.612718+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- kept covariate coefficient θPNA=0.357 (covariate PNA) — not an ontology parameter
- kept covariate coefficient θGA=2.37 (covariate GA) — not an ontology parameter
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=amoxicillin
- bound model equation to Q22 (CL): CLA = TVCL*(BW/70)^0.75*(PNA/6.8)^θPNA*(GA/35.8)^θGA
- bound model equation to Q63 (V1): VA = TVV1*(BW/70)^1.00
- Q22 (CL) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'TVCL (L/h)'; equation kept verbatim
- Q63 (V1) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'TVV1 (L)'; equation kept verbatim
- 1C volume normalization: Q63→Q61 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'TVV1 (L)' is the general volume)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Reviewer per-scenario checks:**

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| T3_param_coverage | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no emitted model to inspect (engineer build absent) |
| T6_deviations | not captured | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | no engineer deviations to adjudicate |
