## About

**Description.** Tirzepatide is a novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. Dual GIP/GLP-1 agonists gained increasing attention as new therapeutic agents for glycemic and weight control as they demonstrated better glucose control and weight loss compared to selective GLP-1 receptor agonists in preclinical and clinical trials.[A246260]

Tirzepatide comprises a 39 amino acid linear synthetic peptide conjugated to a C20 fatty diacid moiety.[A246260] Its protein sequence was based on the sequence of endogenous GIP, and its pharmacological action on GLP-1 receptors is comparable to endogenous GIP; however, the long half-life of tirzepatide allows for once-weekly dosing.[A246265] Tirzepatide was approved by the FDA on May 13, 2022, under the brand name MOUNJARO by the FDA for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes, making it the first and only GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist for this indication.[L41820] Later, it was approved under a different brand name ZEPBOUND on November 8, 2023, for the chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related condition.[L48766] On September 15, 2022, tirzepatide was also approved by the European Commission.[L44386]. On November 02, 2023, tirzepatide was also approved by the Health Canada [L52800]

**Indication.** Tirzepatide is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus or for chronic weight management in obese or overweight adult patients with at least one weight-related comorbid condition.[L41815,L44376,L52325] In Europe, it may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs used to treat diabetes.[L44376]

Tirzepatide is also indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea in adult patients with obesity.[L52325]

This drug has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Tirzepatide is not indicated for use in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.[L41815]

<summary>What the PGx columns mean</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>gene</code></td><td>the gene whose variants the record is about. One record per gene, so a paper reporting several genes appears on several rows.</td></tr><tr><td><code>affects</code></td><td>the PK or PD parameter the genotype SHIFTS, as an ontology Q-code plus its name — Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F (apparent clearance), Q32 = Cmax, Q88 = AUC, Q40 = Fab, Q321 = EC50, Q322 = IC50, Q305 = kfm. The record's per-phenotype theta is a multiplier ON that parameter: a poor-metaboliser theta shifts this value, it does not supply one. Two values are NOT parameters — Q100 (NIL) is an association or risk finding with no parameter target, and `safety` is an adverse-reaction risk such as an HLA allele. A PA… id instead of a Q-code marks a record derived from a ClinPGx/PharmGKB guideline lookup rather than read out of the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>mechanism</code></td><td>how the gene acts: metabolism, transport, target, formation, safety_allele, or unknown.</td></tr><tr><td><code>detail</code></td><td>the paper stem, linking to the full record page.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
