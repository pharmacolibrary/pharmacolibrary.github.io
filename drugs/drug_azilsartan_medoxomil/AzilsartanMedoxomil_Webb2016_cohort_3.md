<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has azilsartan_medoxomil, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 5 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

> ℹ️ No reviewer record yet — status shown is the scholar **validate** result; simulation-based reviewer checks have not been run.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `azilsartan_medoxomil`, measured `azilsartan`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Dose' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab1:row2:col9'])
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'AUC0-∞, [ng⋅h/mL]/[mg/kg]' → Q17 (unit '[mass]' vs ontology '[mass] * [time] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- metabolite azilsartan: Q27→Q375 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided), normalised to a standard size
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=azilsartan
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- template fit: none — noncompartmental model — not a compartmental parent–metabolite model
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'cohort 3' subgroup of Webb_2016 (paper reports 3 populations: cohort 1, cohort 2, cohort 3)
- row roles (LLM): model_class=noncompartmental; 6/6 row label(s) assigned, 16 linked by role; re-tagged azilsartan→M-II ×8
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures 'azilsartan', not azilsartan_medoxomil — the review values are the parent's
