A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Buprenorphine (measured concentrations) drives Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (in score): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

> Buprenorphine plasma concentration (ng/mL) inhibits the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score via an inhibitory Imax (sigmoid Emax-type) model, with baseline COWS 45.3, Imax fixed to 1.00, IC50 0.075 ng/mL, and IC90 0.109 ng/mL; the paper does not describe a mechanistic production/elimination (kin/kout) or effect-compartment structure.

- **paper:** `Walsh_2024`
- **model family:** `sigmoid_emax`

## Exposure-response model

`Hydromorphone_Walsh2024_PD_cows` — sigmoid_emax, `response = E0 + Emax*frac`

| parameter | value (paper units) | SI |
|---|---|---|
| E0 | 45.3 score | — |
| Emax | -1 score | — |
| EC50 | 0.116 ng/mL | 1.16e-07 kg/m3 |
| gamma | 1 | — |

Closed-form check points (response, SI): `at_0` = 45.3, `at_EC50` = 44.8, `at_inf` = 44.3

Deviations:

- `defaulted_parameters` — gamma
- `pd_binding_off_target_driver` — driver compound 'buprenorphine' is not 'hydromorphone' nor one of its metabolites — the curve belongs to that compound's exposure (S12)
- `pd_binding_imax_as_negative_emax` — Imax (Q323) enters SigmoidEmaxSweep as −Emax

## Review

Verdict <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span> · route to `scholar`

| check | status | note |
|---|---|---|
| `T0_driver` | fail | off-target driver — the curve belongs to that compound |
| `T1_closed_form` | pass | engineer's check points reproduced from the bound parameters |
| `T1b_fmu` | pass | shared PD_SigmoidEmaxSweep FMU reproduces the reference points (worst 0.00%) |
| `T2_direction` | pass | the response falls, as direct effect predicts |
| `T3_plausibility` | pass | EC50, gamma, Imax and baseline in range |
| `T4_defaults` | advisory | only convention defaults (gamma = 1) |

Blocking:

- off_target_driver: 'buprenorphine' is not 'hydromorphone' (S12)

Advisory:

- defaulted: gamma (convention)
