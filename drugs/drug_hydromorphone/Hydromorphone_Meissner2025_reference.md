A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The hydromorphone record was rejected because its metabolism link has no parameter (formation clearance is 'none'), leaving hydromorphone unlinked, and the central volume of distribution was reported as 7% — a unit that could not be converted to SI, so no SI value exists.**

The record lists a hydromorphone link with relation 'none' and link parameter 'none', so the metabolite has no path from the dose (unlinked metabolite). The central volume of distribution for morphine and hydromorphone carries the verbatim unit '%', which is not a valid unit for a volume of distribution and could not be converted to SI, so the parameter had no usable numeric value. A second reader also disagreed on the primary analyte (morphine; hydromorphone versus morphine and hydromorphone) and on whether the morphine-to-glucuronide metabolism link exists, and read the clearance 83.8 L/h and volume 7 under different parameter labels; these disagreements are unresolved. Extracted — morphine and hydromorphone: CL 83.8 L h À1, V 7 %.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which molecule was measured: this record has morphine and hydromorphone, the second reading morphine; hydromorphone; it also differs on 5 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

**Model structure:** general linear; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 2 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 's R,MOR' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row11:col2', 'tab_1:row11:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 's A,MOR' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row12:col2', 'tab_1:row12:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 's R,HMO' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row13:col2', 'tab_1:row13:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 's A,HMO' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row14:col2', 'tab_1:row14:col3'])
- salvaged Q22 ('CL 1 (L h À1 )*'=83.8) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q61 ('central volume of distribution'=7) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=morphine and hydromorphone
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
