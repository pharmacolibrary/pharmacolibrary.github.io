**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The moxifloxacin model was quarantined because clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, absorption lag time and both intercompartmental rate constants had no source values and library placeholders were used instead.**

Although the paper reports apparent parameters for moxifloxacin (CL/F 6.90 L/h, V1/F 61.1 L, Q/F 0.860 L/h, V2/F 44.5 L, MAT 1.01 h), the model's clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, absorption lag time, central→peripheral rate constant and peripheral→central rate constant had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. The builder also assumed F=1 and Fm=1 without molar correction, giving an apparent (/F) parameterization, and used first-order depot input consistent with extravascular dosing. The absorption rate constant was defaulted because it was not reported in the source, and this invented absorption was judged not acceptable; the deviations check could not compute a comparison (ratio None). Extracted — moxifloxacin: CL/F 6.9, V1/F 61.1, Q/F 0.86, V2/F 44.5, MAT 1.01 h.

Independently confirmed by `gpt-oss:120b`.

**Model structure:** 2-compartment, oral mammillary model — template `PK_2C_enteral`.  
**Parameters:** 5 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, Q/F, V1/F, V2/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `model_quarantined`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=moxifloxacin

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- unparsed cell Palmer_2025_table_p6_1:row6:col1 = '1 (fixed)'

**Cross-check (independent readings):** <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span>

A record can have several readers.</td></tr><tr><td><code>agreement</code></td><td>share of the compared fields that reader agreed on.</td></tr><tr><td><code>verdict</code></td><td>per reader: `confirmed` it agrees throughout · `partly confirmed` a non-structural field differs · `not confirmed` a structural one differs (clearance, a volume, ka, a lag) · `primary re-run` the first reading extracted nothing and was given one hinted retry.</td></tr><tr><td><code>combined</code></td><td>the record's verdict over ALL its readers: confirmed only when every reader that answered agrees, disputed as soon as one disagrees on a structural parameter. The most favourable reading is never taken — an extra reader must not be a way to find one that agrees.</td></tr><tr><td><code>kept</code></td><td>which reading the record holds.
