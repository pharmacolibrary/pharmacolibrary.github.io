## About

**Description.** Metreleptin, a recombinant analog of the human hormone leptin, is an orphan drug used to treat complications of leptin deficiency in people with lipodystrophy. Lipodystrophies include a range of disorders characterized by the reduction, absence, or altered distribution of adipose tissue.[A263126] Complications of lipodystrophy include metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and fatty liver disease.[A263126] These metabolic abnormalities are often aggravated by excessive food intake, which is further aggravated by leptin deficiency, a protein secreted by adipose tissue.[L41315] Administration of metreleptin results in improvement of metabolic symptoms including improvements in insulin resistance, reduced HbA1c and fasting glucose, reduced triglycerides, and reductions in food intake. Metreleptin is produced in _E. coli_ and differs from native human leptin by the addition of a methionine residue at its amino terminus.[L41315]

In February 2014, metreleptin was approved by the FDA for the treatment of complications of leptin deficiency, as an adjunct to diet, in patients with congenital generalized or acquired generalized lipodystrophy.[L41315] Metreleptin was approved by Health Canada in January 2024 for the same patient population, in addition to patients with partial lipodystrophy.[L49901]

**Indication.** Metreleptin is indicated as an adjunct to diet as replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy.[L41315,L49901] In Canada, it is additionally approved for use in patients ≥12 years old with confirmed familial partial lipodystrophy or acquired partial lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons syndrome) and persistent significant metabolic disease for whom standard treatments have failed to achieve adequate metabolic control.[L49901]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
