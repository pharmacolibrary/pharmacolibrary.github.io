## About

Metreleptin is a protein drug used to treat lipodystrophy, including acquired and familial partial forms. It is authorised in the European Union, but carries a boxed warning, so its use is limited.

<small>Summary written by `glm-5.3-flash` from [Wikidata Q17143468](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17143468) and the WHO ATC classification and the EMA medicines list; not checked by a person.</small>

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
