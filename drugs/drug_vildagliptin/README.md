## About

**Description.** Vildagliptin (LAF237) is an orally active antihyperglycemic agent that selectively inhibits the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme. It is used to manage type II diabetes mellitus, where GLP-1 secretion and insulinotropic effects are impaired.[A232488] By inhibiting DPP-4, vildagliptin prevents the degradation of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which are incretin hormones that promote insulin secretion and regulate blood glucose levels. Elevated levels of GLP-1 and GIP consequently results in improved glycemic control.[L32803] In clinical trials, vildagliptin has a relatively low risk of hypoglycemia.[A232488]

Oral vildagliptin was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2008 for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus in adults as monotherapy or in combination with [metformin], a sulfonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione in patients with inadequate glycemic control following monotherapy. It is marketed as Galvus.[L32803] Vildagliptin is also available as Eucreas, a fixed-dose formulation with metformin for adults in who do not adequately glycemic control from monotherapy.[L32813] Vildagliptin is currently under investigation in the US.

**Indication.** Vildagliptin is indicated in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus in adults. As monotherapy, vildagliptin is indicated in adults inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance.[L32803] It is also indicated as dual therapy in combination with metformin, a sulphonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione in adults patients with insufficient glycemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy.[L32803] 

Vildagliptin is also marketed in a combination product with [metformin] for the treatment of adults with type II diabetes mellitus who inadequately respond to either monotherapy of vildagliptin or metformin. This fixed-dose formulation can be used in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin (i.e., triple therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in adults who do not achieve adequate glycemic control with monotherapy or dual therapy.[L32813]

The record's per-phenotype theta is a multiplier ON that parameter: a poor-metaboliser theta shifts this value, it does not supply one. Two values are NOT parameters — Q100 (NIL) is an association or risk finding with no parameter target, and `safety` is an adverse-reaction risk such as an HLA allele. A PA… id instead of a Q-code marks a record derived from a ClinPGx/PharmGKB guideline lookup rather than read out of the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>mechanism</code></td><td>how the gene acts: metabolism, transport, target, formation, safety_allele, or unknown.</td></tr><tr><td><code>detail</code></td><td>the paper stem, linking to the full record page.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
