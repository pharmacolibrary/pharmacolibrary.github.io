## About

**Description.** Gefitinib (originally coded ZD1839) is a drug used in the treatment of certain types of cancer. Acting in a similar manner to erlotinib (marketed as Tarceva), gefitinib selectively targets the mutant proteins in malignant cells. It is marketed by AstraZeneca under the trade name Iressa.

**Indication.** For the continued treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of either platinum-based or docetaxel chemotherapies.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Haaland_2014 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical efficacy meta-analysis reporting survival and response rates, containing no pharmacokinetic parameters for gefitinib. |
| popPK | Hotta_2021 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | Gefitinib is a co-administered agent and the study reports PK parameters solely for edoxaban, with only trough concentrations provided for gefitinib. |
| popPK | Janssen_2022 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The study focuses on ctDNA biomarker modeling rather than gefitinib pharmacokinetics, explicitly noting that external PK models were used and no quantitative disposition parameters are reported. |
| popPK | Kawata_2019 | relevant | 10 | 2 | The study is a population PK analysis of gefitinib, but the actual numeric parameter estimates are referenced in Table 2 and supplementary materials that are not provided in the evidence. |
| popPK | Kramer_2017 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study reports pharmacokinetic parameters for the PET tracer 18F-FLT, not for gefitinib, which is only mentioned as background therapy. |
| popPK | Leighl_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses exclusively on patient-reported outcomes and quality of life in a clinical trial, with no pharmacokinetic data or modeling for gefitinib reported. |
| popPK | Li_2021 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The study explicitly states that no gefitinib plasma concentrations were collected, so no pharmacokinetic parameters for gefitinib are reported or extractable. |
| popPK | Nishino_2013 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | This is a tumor growth/response study in gefitinib-treated NSCLC, not a PK study, and no gefitinib disposition parameters are reported. |
| popPK | Nishino_2016 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an oncology imaging study assessing tumor volume and survival, containing no pharmacokinetic data or disposition parameters for gefitinib. |
| popPK | Wanika_2024 | irrelevant | 2 | 9 | The numeric parameter estimates for gefitinib are directly provided in Table 2 of the main text, but the study is strictly an in vitro cell-line model rather than a human or animal disposition study. |
| popPK | Xiong_2022 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study exclusively reports population pharmacokinetic parameters for tepotinib, with gefitinib only mentioned as a co-administered drug and no PK values provided for it. |
