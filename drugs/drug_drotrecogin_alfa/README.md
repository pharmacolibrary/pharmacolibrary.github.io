Drotrecogin alfa, a form of activated protein C, was used to treat severe sepsis. It was later withdrawn from the market, including in the European Union, after it failed to demonstrate sufficient benefit for patients.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
