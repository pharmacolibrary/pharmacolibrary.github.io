# Drotrecogin alfa

- **generic name:** Drotrecogin alfa
- **ATC codes:** `B01AD10`
- **DrugBank:** [DB00055](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00055) · **PubChem:** not captured
- **groups:** approved, withdrawn

## About

**Description.** Drotrecogin alfa is activated human protein C that is synthesized by recombinant DNA technology. It is a glycoprotein of approximately 55 kilodalton molecular weight, consisting of a heavy chain and a light chain linked by a disulfide bond. Drotrecogin alfa was withdrawn from the market after a major study indicated that it was not effective in improving outcomes in patients with sepsis.

**Indication.** For reduction of mortality in patients with severe sepsis.

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.
