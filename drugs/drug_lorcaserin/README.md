## About

**Description.** Lorcaserin (previously APD-356), a highly selective 5HT2C receptor agonist, is used for the treatment of obesity. It has been shown to reduce body weight and food intake in animal models of obesity, and it is thought that targeting the 5HT2C receptor may alter body weight by regulating satiety. Lorcaserin is marketed as a salt form called Belviq, which is lorcaserin hydrochloride.

In February 2020, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication requesting the manufacturer of Belviq (lorcaserin hydrochloride tablets, 10 mg) and Belviq XR (lorcaserin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, 20 mg) to voluntarily withdraw these products from the U.S. market, and the company has submitted a request to voluntarily withdraw the drug. This decision was based on the results of a clinical trial assessing the risk of heart-related problems that found that patients treated with lorcaserin may have a higher risk of cancer.[L44042,L44047]

**Indication.** For the treatment of obesity, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
