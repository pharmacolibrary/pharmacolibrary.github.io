The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

  ·  DOI: [10.1002/cpdd.889](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpdd.889)

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="belimumab" model-id="Belimumab_Dimelow2021_reference" status="rejected" stale="false" population="paediatric patients with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE)" measured-compound="belimumab" parameterization="mechanistic" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 0 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

_No resolved parameters._

### Unresolved rows _(no Q-code or no value — not parameters)_
| label (paper) | Q-code | value | link |
|---|---|---|---|
| V2 (mL) | Q64 | not captured | exact |

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'implementation' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Effect of BFFM' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['cpdd889-tbl-0002:row3:col1', 'cpdd889-tbl-0002:row8:col1', 'cpdd889-tbl-0002:row11:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Effect of BEGFR' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['cpdd889-tbl-0002:row4:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Effect of BIGG' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['cpdd889-tbl-0002:row5:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Effect of BPROT' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['cpdd889-tbl-0002:row6:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Effect of BWBC' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['cpdd889-tbl-0002:row9:col1'])
- table mostly unlinked (5/6 table-cell rows NIL) — likely the wrong table was located, not 1 genuinely-missing ontology parameter(s); route_to_review instead of building a model from the residual linked cell(s)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=belimumab
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- molar mass: none found for 'belimumab' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- review gap-fill skipped: this record carries no value of its own, and a model assembled entirely from other papers is not this paper's model

## Validation

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C0_has_structural_params | fail | not captured | 0 | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C0b_disposition_core | fail | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C5_dimension_Q64 | pass | [length] ** 3 | not captured | not captured | not captured | ['cpdd889-tbl-0002:row12:col1'] |
| C8_topology | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |

<summary>Check legend — what each column means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>check</code></td><td>the check id. C0_has_structural_params = at least one numeric structural parameter; C0b_disposition_core = a volume OR a clearance/elimination term (neither means an exposure/outcome paper, not popPK — rejected); C0c_disposition_complete = BOTH a volume AND a clearance/elimination term, which is what the engineer needs to build (one without the other routes to review, never to the engineer); C1_half_life(_beta) = reported half-life against V and CL; C2_reference = covariate scenarios are sign-plausible; C3_cl_dose_auc = CL against dose/AUC; C4_auc_closed_form = AUC recomputed in closed form; C5_dimension_&lt;Qcode&gt; = the parameter's units carry the dimension its Q-code requires.</td></tr><tr><td><code>status</code></td><td>pass, fail, or skipped. A skipped check had nothing to compare — the paper did not report the input it needs — and is not evidence against the record. The scholar table lists only pass and fail; the reviewer table also shows skipped, with the reason in note.</td></tr><tr><td><code>expected</code></td><td>the value the check required, from the paper or from the ontology.</td></tr><tr><td><code>obtained</code></td><td>what the record actually yields.</td></tr><tr><td><code>ratio</code></td><td>obtained / expected, where the check is a numeric comparison.</td></tr><tr><td><code>tol</code></td><td>the tolerance the ratio had to fall within to pass.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>the artifact the expected value was taken from.</td></tr><tr><td><code>scenario</code></td><td>reviewer table only — the covariate scenario the check was run under.</td></tr><tr><td><code>note</code></td><td>why a check was skipped, or how it was judged.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Models

<p>No downloads: this record is <b>rejected</b>, so it is not published as a model. Any archives generated for it before the verdict have been removed — a download outlives the page that explains it.</p>

_No web simulator for this record: its structure has no shared WebAssembly template. The FMI archive under **Models** carries its own compiled FMU._
