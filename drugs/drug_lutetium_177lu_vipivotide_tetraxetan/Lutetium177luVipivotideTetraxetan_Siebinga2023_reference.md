**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The record for lutetium-177 vipivotide tetraxetan was rejected because its structure is a two-compartment model, yet it carries rate constants and volumes (k13 0.00867 h−1, k31 0.0141 h−1, k14 0.0238 h−1, k41 0.0283 h−1, V3 30.4 L) pointing to compartments outside that structure.**

The declared topology is a two-compartment model, but the parameter set includes transfers to a second and third peripheral compartment (k13/k31 and k14/k41) and a volume V3 of 30.4 L, leaving compartments with no place in the stated structure — the orphan-compartment finding. The second reader also disagreed on several parameters: they read a Bmax of 40.4 for compartment 2, a k15 of 0.000248 h−1 with tumor-volume effect 0.705, and no compartment-2/3 volumes, whereas this record lists V2 24.6 L and V3 30.4 L. Disagreements on dose compound and primary analyte were only naming variants of the same molecule. Extracted — lutetium 177lu vipivotide tetraxetan: kel 0.288 h−1, k12 0.0238 h−1, k21 0.0307 h−1, k13 0.00867 h−1, k31 0.0141 h−1, k14 0.0238 h−1, k41 0.0283 h−1, V1 10.3 L, … (+2).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has lutetium_177lu_vipivotide_tetraxetan, the second reading lutetium-177 lu vipivotide tetraxetan; it also differs on 6 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.
