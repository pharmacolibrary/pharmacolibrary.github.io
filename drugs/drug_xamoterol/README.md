## About

**Description.** Xamoterol is a β1-adrenoceptor partial agonist that has shown to improve systolic and diastolic function in studies with heart failure patients. It modulates the sympathetic control of the heart but has no agonist action on β2-adrenoceptors.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
