**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The abacavir two-compartment model was rejected because one compartment is unreachable from the dose: the record lists both Q (0.802 l/h) and Q/F (2.0 l/h) as intercompartmental clearances, leaving the peripheral compartment's connection ambiguous.**

The record for abacavir in HIV-infected infants, toddlers and children contains two intercompartmental clearance parameters, Q with value 0.802 (no unit given) and Q/F with value 2.0 l/h, both described as the clearance between the central and peripheral compartment. With two competing values for the same structural link, the two-compartment topology could not be resolved as a connected structure, so the peripheral compartment (V2/F = 13.5 l) was treated as unreachable from the dose. The remaining parameters (kabs 0.913 h⁻¹, CL/F 20.1 l/h, V1/Fref 13.0 l) are otherwise complete. Extracted — abacavir: kabs 0.913 h -1, CL/F 20.1 l h -1, Q 0.802, V2/F 13.5 l, Q/F 2 l h -1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has abacavir, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'Q/F' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (%)')
- table section iiv: 'V1/F' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (%)')
- table section iiv: 'V2/F' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (%)')
- table section iiv: 'CL/F' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (%)')
- table section iov: 'CL/F' routed out of structural estimates ('Interoccasion variability (%)')
- table section iov: 'Residual proportional (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('Interoccasion variability (%)')
- dropped duplicate Q30 ('q2', value '0.810') — already have one for this compound
- implicit units: 'CL/Fref' → L/h (from the paper text: 'Table 3 states CL/F (l h -1) = 13.4 ... for abacavir clearance, indicating CL/F is in l h-1.')
- implicit units: 'q1' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'Q/F is intercompartmental clearance; paper defines Q/F as intercompartment clearance but gives no unit; convention is L/')
- implicit units: 'V1/Fref' → L (from the paper text: 'Table 3 states V/F (l) = 64.8 ... and V/F (l) = 42.9 ..., indicating volumes of distribution in l.')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=abacavir
- bound model equation to Q290 (V1/F): V1/F = 13.0 ¥ (BW/17.6)^0.810
- Q290 (V1/F) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'V1/Fref'; equation kept verbatim
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
- captured model equation V1/F = 13.0 ¥ (BW/17.6)^0.810
