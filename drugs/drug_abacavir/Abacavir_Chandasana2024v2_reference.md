**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The abacavir children's HIV-1 model was held back because kabs and V/F carry no unit, so their values (2.08 h−1, 32.7 l) cannot be converted to SI.**

Kabs and V/F have no unit; without a unit the values cannot be converted, so the model cannot use them. The record also lists conflicting weight-exponent values for the same covariate effects (0.794, 0.455, 0.758 for clearance; 0.556 versus 0.698 for volume), and a second reader assigned 0.698 to the volume exponent while this record gives 0.556. The weight-based consistency check could not compute a comparison (ratio None), so it is inconclusive rather than a demonstrated fault. The dose compound is also disputed: abacavir versus abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine. Extracted — abacavir: CL/F 16.3 L/h, V2/F 10.1 l, kabs 2.08, Q/F 1.69 l/h, V3/F 23 l, Fab 1.62, V1/F 23.1 l, V/F 32.7, … (+1).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has abacavir, the second reading abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine fixed-dose combination; it also differs on 2 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

- column 'auc0–24(µg*h/ml)' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- column 'c24(µg/ml)' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Weight bands' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab4:row0:col3', 'Tab4:row0:col4'])
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('Apparent clearance, CL/F [l/h]', value '9.16') — already have one for this compound

- dropped duplicate Q49 ('Absorption rate constant, KA ~ DT and granules [h−1]', value '2.04') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'FMAT' (equation variable)
- dropped PD-category row 'Hill coefficient related to the slope of the enzyme maturation process' → Q325 (Hill, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Chandasana_2024_2_table_2:row11:col1'])
- covariate category for Ct from footnote/prose kept as documentation only (['Tab4:footnote'])
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'AUC' from footnote/prose loose number 37 (source ['Tab4:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- covariate category for AUC from footnote/prose kept as documentation only (['Tab4:footnote'])
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number 6.3 (source ['Tab4:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- covariate effect for Q353 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- covariate effect for Q76 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- implicit units: 'Absorption rate constant, KA [h−1]' → 1/h (from the paper text: 'Table 2 footnote/parameter list states KA [h−1] = 2.08, i.e., reciprocal hours.')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=abacavir
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
