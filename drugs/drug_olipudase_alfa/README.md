## About

**Description.** Olipudase alfa is recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase.[A251590] It is the first and only enzyme replacement therapy in the world for the treatment of Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (ASMD), also known as Niemann–Pick disease.[L42740] ASMD is a rare lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the SMPD1 gene, leading to a deficiency in acid sphingomyelinase and the abnormal accumulation of the primary ASM substrate, sphingomyelin.[A251600] Olipudase alfa works to hydrolyze sphingomyelin accumulated in body tissues, such as the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and bone marrow.[A251590] 

Olipudase alfa gained its first global approval in Japan on March 28, 2022.[A251590] It was later approved by the European Commission on June 28, 2022 [L42740] and by the FDA on August 31, 2022.[L43145]

**Indication.** Olipudase alfa is indicated as an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of non–central nervous system manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) in adult and pediatric patients.[L49146]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
