<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Amsterdam_1980 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is a review that explicitly states more definitive studies are needed to determine plasma levels for butriptyline, and no quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters are provided. |
| popPK | Bonnet_1984 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic investigation of dopamine uptake/release in rat synaptosomes, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting disposition parameters for butriptyline. |
| PD | Bonnet_1984 | not_relevant | 3 | 2 | The paper reports a qualitative observation of dopamine release at high concentrations (&gt;3 x 10^-6 M) for butriptyline but does not provide specific numeric PD parameters (like IC50 or Emax) or a full concentration-effect curve for this specific drug in the provided text. |
| popPK | Bourgouin_1981 | relevant | 9 | 2 | The paper is a relevant human PK study for butriptyline, but the evidence only provides descriptive metrics (Tmax, Cmax, half-life) and lacks the specific quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, Q, ka) required for extraction. |
| popPK | Boyer_1980 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a general review discussing clinical efficacy correlations and drug interactions without reporting original quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters for butriptyline. |
| popPK | Crawley_1981 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a behavioral pharmacology study using butriptyline only as a negative control to demonstrate specificity, with no pharmacokinetic parameters reported. |
| PD | Crawley_1981 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper only qualitatively states that butriptyline did not produce the behavioral effect in a specific animal model, without providing any numeric dose-response data, concentration-effect curves, or PD parameters. |
| popPK | Guelfi_1983 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical efficacy trial comparing butriptyline and amitriptyline, reporting no pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| PD | Guelfi_1983 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical trial comparing efficacy and side effects at fixed/flexible doses but does not report plasma concentrations or any quantitative exposure-response or dose-response modeling. |
| popPK | Kopanski_1983 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a mechanistic investigation of adrenergic receptor sensitivity in rat brain tissue and does not report quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters for butriptyline. |
| popPK | Randrup_1977 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | no_text gate: only 118 chars of text extracted (&lt; 400) |
| PD | Randrup_1977 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a theoretical review discussing the dopamine hypothesis and amine uptake inhibition, containing no experimental PK/PD data or numeric parameters for butriptyline. |
| popPK | Risch_1979 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of clinical efficacy and plasma levels, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting quantitative disposition parameters for butriptyline. |
