**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**The paclitaxel model was quarantined because bioavailability, clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and lag time had no source values and library placeholders were substituted, with one reported unit unconvertible to SI.**

Although the record lists paclitaxel parameters (CL 34.4 L/h, V2 176 L, Q 48.0 L/h, V3 855 L, kabs 0.724 1/h, Frel 0.895), the model builder defaulted F, Cl, Vd, ka and Tlag because they were not reported in the source, and the invented absorption (defaulted ka) was judged not acceptable. One reported unit could not be converted to SI units, so that parameter was carried without a usable numeric value. The covariate scenarios were not simulated — only the reference individual — and the second reader disagreed on the log-additive parameter, reading 0.208 where the record has none. Extracted — paclitaxel: CL 34.4, V2 176 L, Q 48 L/h, V3 855 L, kabs 0.724, Frel 0.895 proportional.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of log additive: this record has none, the second reading 0.208. That field does not shape the model.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'proportional' (Frel)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Log additive' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['He_2022_table_p7_1:row16:col1', 'He_2022_table_p7_1:row16:col2'])
- dropped value-less row: 'OFV'
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Condition number' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['He_2022_table_p7_1:row18:col3'])
- dropped value-less row: 'CL'
- dropped value-less row: 'F1'
- dropped value-less row: 'GI'
- dropped value-less row: 'KA'
- dropped value-less row: 'popPK'
- dropped value-less row: 'Q'
- dropped value-less row: 'V2'
- dropped value-less row: 'V3'
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=paclitaxel
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- unparsed cell He_2022_table_p7_1:row6:col1 = '0.215 (fixed)'
- unparsed cell He_2022_table_p7_1:row7:col1 = '0.119 (fixed)'
