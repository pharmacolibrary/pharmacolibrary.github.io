A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**CL and kabs have no unit.**

Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. A reported unit could not be converted (Frel), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — paclitaxel: CL 34.4, V2 176 L, Q 48 L/h, V3 855 L, kabs 0.724, Frel 0.895 proportional.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of log additive: this record has none, the second reading 0.208. That field does not shape the model.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'proportional' (Frel)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Log additive' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['He_2022_table_p7_1:row16:col1', 'He_2022_table_p7_1:row16:col2'])
- dropped value-less row: 'OFV'
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Condition number' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['He_2022_table_p7_1:row18:col3'])
- dropped value-less row: 'CL'
- dropped value-less row: 'F1'
- dropped value-less row: 'GI'
- dropped value-less row: 'KA'
- dropped value-less row: 'popPK'
- dropped value-less row: 'Q'
- dropped value-less row: 'V2'
- dropped value-less row: 'V3'
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=paclitaxel
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- unparsed cell He_2022_table_p7_1:row6:col1 = '0.215 (fixed)'
- unparsed cell He_2022_table_p7_1:row7:col1 = '0.119 (fixed)'
