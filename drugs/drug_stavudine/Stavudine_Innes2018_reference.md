<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**CLm/F, V1, Q and V2 have no unit.**

Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. A reported unit could not be converted (CLm/F, V1, Q and V2), so that value has no SI equivalent. None of the extracted parameters is stavudine's own; they describe stavudine triphosphate. Extracted — stavudine triphosphate: CLm/F 230 n = 23, V1 1.04e+03 n = 23, Q 238 n = 23, V2 3.03e+03 n = 23, kabs 11.1 /h, tlag 0.41 h.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `needs_review` (reviewed 2026-10-07 14:42:50.471812+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 16:16:53.981804+00:00). Current validate status: `needs_review`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `stavudine`, measured `stavudine triphosphate`.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="stavudine" model-id="Stavudine_Innes2018_reference" status="needs_review" stale="true" population="HIV-infected children and adults on stavudine" measured-compound="stavudine triphosphate" parameterization="apparent" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 5 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CLm/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 23' (CL)
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('CL (1012 cells/h)', value '230') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 23' (V1)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 23' (Q)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 23' (V2)
- implicit units: 'Vc (1012 cells)' — the LLM proposed '1012 cells', whose dimension does not fit Q63; left unset
- implicit units: 'Q (1012 cells/h)' — the LLM proposed '1012 cells/h', whose dimension does not fit Q30; left unset
- implicit units: 'Vp (1012 cells)' — the LLM proposed '1012 cells', whose dimension does not fit Q64; left unset
- metabolite stavudine triphosphate: Q22→Q351 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=stavudine triphosphate
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 10/10 row label(s) assigned, 8 linked by role
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Sinxadi_2010's review values (primary lacked it)
- gap-filled Q83 (tlag) from Sinxadi_2010's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
