## About

**Description.** Chlortetracycline is a _tetracycline_ antibiotic, and historically the first member of this class to be identified. It was discovered in 1945 by the scientist, Benjamin Minge Duggar, working at Lederle Laboratories under the supervision of Yellapragada Subbarow. He discovered that this antibiotic was the product of an actinomycete strain he cultured and obtained from a soil sample from a field in Missouri. The organism was named _Streptomyces aureofaciens_ due to its gold-hued color.

**Indication.** Used in the manufacuring of medicated animal feeds [FDA Label].

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
