> **Species: horse.** This record comes from an animal study (horse), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The butorphanol model fails to reproduce the paper's reported peak concentration (Cmax 0.00014 vs 2.17e-05) and time of peak (tmax 0.43 h vs 2.84 h), and the absorption rate constant ka was invented rather than taken from the source.**

Simulated as dosed in the paper, the model's Cmax is about 0.1552 of the reported value and its tmax is 6.5992 times the reported 0.43 h, both outside tolerance. The model builder substituted library defaults for the absorption rate constant ka, the lag time Tlag, and the distribution rate constants k12, k21, k13 and k31, none of which are reported in the source; the invented absorption was judged not acceptable. Bioavailability was assumed to be 1 with no molar correction, so all parameters are apparent (V/F, CL/F, Q3/F). Extracted — butorphanol: kabs 6.28, V/F 0.465 L/kg, V2/F 0.42 L/kg, V3/F 0.368 L/kg, CL/F 9.85 mL/min/kg, Q3/F 0.667 mL/min/kg, V 0.144, V2 0.295, … (+4).

**Model structure:** 3-compartment, oral mammillary model — template `PK_3C_enteral`.  
**Parameters:** 12 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, Q3/F, V/F, V2/F, V3/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['ka', 'Tlag', 'k12', 'k21', 'k13', 'k31']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)
- `invented_absorption`: ka defaulted — not reported in source

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q309 ('tvCl3/F (mL/min/kg)', value '2.98') — already have one for this compound
- routed 'stdev0' → Q315 (sigma) to residual_error — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('Ka', value '0.412') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=butorphanol
- population split: 'estimate' subgroup of Knych_2024 (paper reports 2 populations: estimate, shrinkage)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
