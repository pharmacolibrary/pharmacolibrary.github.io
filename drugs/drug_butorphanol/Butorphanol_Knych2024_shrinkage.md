A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

> **Species: horse.** This record comes from an animal study (horse), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The model does not reproduce the paper's peak concentration (Cmax) (paper 0.00014, model 3.84e-05); the model does not reproduce the paper's time of the peak (tmax) (paper 0.43, model 0.642).**

Simulated as the paper dosed it, the model's peak concentration (Cmax) differs from the value the paper reports by more than the tolerance. Simulated as the paper dosed it, the model's time of the peak (tmax) differs from the value the paper reports by more than the tolerance. Extracted — butorphanol: kabs 6.28 1/h, V/F 0.465 L/kg, V2/F 0.42 L/kg, CL/F 9.85 mL/min/kg, V 0.144, V2 0.295, CL 0.053, Q 0.71.

**Model structure:** 3-compartment, oral mammillary model — template `PK_3C_enteral`.  
**Parameters:** 8 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F, V2/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['Tlag', 'k12', 'k21', 'k13', 'k31']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped value-less row: 'tvKa (1/h)' (captured trailing unit '1/h' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'tvV/F (L/kg)' (captured trailing unit 'L/kg' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'tvV2/F (L/kg)' (captured trailing unit 'L/kg' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'tvV3/F (L/kg)' (captured trailing unit 'L/kg' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'tvCl/F (mL/min/kg)' (captured trailing unit 'mL/min/kg' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'tvCl2/F (mL/min/kg)' (captured trailing unit 'mL/min/kg' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'tvCl3/F (mL/min/kg)' (captured trailing unit 'mL/min/kg' for child rows)
- salvaged Q49 ('tvKa (1/h)'=6.28) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q76 ('tvV/F (L/kg)'=0.465) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q82 ('tvV2/F (L/kg)'=0.42) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q27 ('tvCl/F (mL/min/kg)'=9.85) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q61 ('V'=0.144) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q64 ('V2'=0.295) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q22 ('Cl'=0.053) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q30 ('Cl2'=0.71) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=butorphanol
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- structure disagreement: deterministic 3C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'shrinkage' subgroup of Knych_2024 (paper reports 2 populations: estimate, shrinkage)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
