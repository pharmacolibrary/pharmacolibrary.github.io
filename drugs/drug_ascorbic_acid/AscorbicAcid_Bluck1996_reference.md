A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The ascorbic acid record lacks distribution volume and clearance, and the AUC%ext parameter (150.4, unit 'e') has a dimension mismatch, so it is not a compartmental population PK model and was rejected.**

The paper reports no distribution volume and no clearance or elimination rate for ascorbic acid; it is an exposure/outcome paper, not a compartmental population PK model. The structural parameter AUC%ext, extracted as 150.4 with unit 'e', failed a dimensional consistency check. Additionally, the reported unit could not be converted to SI, so the parameter reached the model builder without an SI value. The two readers also disagreed on which parameter was extracted: one read '5% (f) + 95%' as 150.4, the other read '5% (b) + 95%' as 720.7. Extracted — ascorbic acid: AUC%ext 150 e.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of 5% (b) + 95%: this record has none, the second reading 720.7; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.
