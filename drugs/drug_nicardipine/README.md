| PGx | Piao_2008 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates a drug-drug interaction (morin) in rats, not a pharmacogenomic effect (gene variant/genotype) on nicardipine PK/PD. |

| popPK | Prior_1999 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro pharmacological investigation of renal vasodilation mechanisms where nicardipine is used only as a comparator agent, not a PK study. |
| PD | Prior_1999 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates A2A adenosine receptor-mediated vasodilation; nicardipine is only used as a positive control for a non-specific inhibitory effect (ouabain) and no PD parameters for nicardipine are reported. |
| PGx | Roitberg_2008 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of nicardipine and nitroprusside, with no mention of genetic variants or pharmacogenomic effects. |
| PGx | Rougée_2017 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the effect of intracellular pH on in vitro enzyme kinetics and PBPK predictions, not the impact of genetic variants on nicardipine pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. |
| popPK | Sadan_2024 | relevant | 10 | 0 | The paper describes a population pharmacokinetic model for nicardipine in humans, but the specific numeric parameter values (clearance, volume, etc.) are not present in the provided evidence text. |
| PGx | Sassi_2015 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports a pharmacokinetic interaction between nicardipine and tacrolimus, not a pharmacogenomic effect on nicardipine's PK/PD parameters. |
| PGx | Satoh_2003 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the inhibitory effects of 29 drugs on estradiol oxidation, not the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of nicardipine. |
| popPK | Shibasaki_1994 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of YM-21095, with nicardipine serving only as a comparator for cardiovascular effects. |
| PGx | Shukla_2006 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper identifies nicardipine as a substrate/inhibitor of the ABCG2 transporter in vitro but does not report any pharmacogenomic analysis (gene variant/genotype) affecting its PK or PD parameters. |
| PGx | Tatosian_2009 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes an in vitro microfluidic system for testing drug combinations in cancer cells and does not report any pharmacogenomic effects on nicardipine PK or PD parameters. |
| PGx | Wu_2020 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the effect of MICA expression on cisplatin sensitivity and ABCG2 downregulation, using nicardipine only as a tool to inhibit ABCG2, rather than reporting a pharmacogenomic effect on nicardipine's PK/PD parameters. |
| PGx | Xia_2012 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the inhibitory effects of nicardipine on CYP3A4 activity (drug-drug interaction potential) and QSAR relationships, but does not report how a gene variant or genotype alters the PK or PD parameters of nicardipine. |
| popPK | Xu_2007 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic investigation of serotonin-induced contraction in guinea-pig colonic myocytes, where nicardipine is used only as a pharmacological tool to block calcium channels, not as the subject of a pharmacokinetic analysis. |
| PD | Xu_2007 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the pharmacology of serotonin (5-HT) on colonic myocytes; nicardipine is used only as a tool compound to block 5-HT effects, and no exposure-response or dose-response relationship for nicardipine itself is reported. |
| PGx | Yamazoe_2020 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper discusses the structural binding mechanism of nicardipine as a CYP3A4 inhibitor using a computational template, but does not report any pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants) on PK or PD parameters. |
| popPK | Yukawa_2001 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study reports pharmacokinetic parameters for digoxin, not nicardipine, which is only mentioned as a co-administered drug affecting digoxin clearance. |
| PGx | Zhou_2005 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the effect of dihydropyridines on BCRP-mediated transport of other drugs (mitoxantrone/topotecan) and does not report pharmacogenomic effects on nicardipine's PK/PD. |
