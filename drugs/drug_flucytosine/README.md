## About

Flucytosine is an antifungal used to treat serious fungal infections such as candidiasis, cryptococcosis including cryptococcal meningitis, aspergillosis, and chromoblastomycosis. It remains in clinical use, is listed among WHO essential medicines, and is available as a systemic and topical antifungal, though it carries a boxed warning.

<small>Summary written by `glm-5.3-flash` from [Wikidata Q238490](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q238490) and the WHO ATC classification; not checked by a person.</small>

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Kim_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on voriconazole and fluconazole, and explicitly states that no studies were identified for flucytosine. |
| popPK | Li_2007 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacodynamics of meropenem, not flucytosine. |
| popPK | Liu_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of MIC distributions and PK/PD indices for antifungals (primarily azoles) in Cryptococcus infections; it does not report original quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, etc.) for flucytosine. |
| popPK | Pongratz_2011 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study assesses in vitro antimalarial activity (EC50) of flucytosine against Plasmodium falciparum, not its pharmacokinetic disposition parameters. |
| popPK | Scott_2020 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | This is a review article summarizing neonatal antifungal pharmacokinetics, and the provided evidence contains no original quantitative disposition parameters for flucytosine. |
| popPK | Stegman_1999 | irrelevant | 2 | 5 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and the conversion of 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) in a gene therapy context, not the disposition of flucytosine (5-FC) itself. |
