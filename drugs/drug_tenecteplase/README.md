## About

**Description.** Tenecteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) developed from modifications of natural human tPA complementary DNA (cDNA). It is a 527 amino acid with a substitution of threonine 103 with asparagine and substitution of asparagine 117 with glutamine within the kringle 1 domain, and a tetra-alanine substitution at amino acids 296-299 in the protease domain.

**Indication.** Tenecteplase is indicated for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in adult patients and to reduce the risk of death in adult patients following acute ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI).[L54918,L54923]

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
