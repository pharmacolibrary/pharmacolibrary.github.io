## About

Tenecteplase is a fibrinolytic (clot-dissolving) drug used to treat acute myocardial infarction, and has also been used for coronary thrombosis and ischemic stroke. It is an approved medicine, authorised in the European Union, and is widely used as a thrombolytic, mainly in hospital settings for heart attacks.

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.
