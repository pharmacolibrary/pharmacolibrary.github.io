## About

**Description.** Ephedrine was first described in western literature in 1888, as a naturally occurring component of the ephedra plant, along with [pseudoephedrine].[A193698] Ephedrine acts as both a direct and indirect sympathomimetic. It is an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist; however, it also causes the indirect release of norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons, inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake and displacing more norepinephrine from storage vesicles.[A193650,L12972] Ephedrine is used for its vasoconstrictive, positive chronotropic, and positive inotropic effects.[L12972] Ephedrine and [phenylephrine] are still used to treat hypotension, but their use in other indications has decreased due to the development of more selective adrenergic agonists.[A193701,A193704,L12975] Ephedrine was granted a type 7 FDA Approval on 29 April 2016.[L12975]

**Indication.** Ephedrine intravenous injections are indicated to treat hypotension under anesthesia,[L12972,L34645] ephedrine injections by multiple routes are indicated to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma,[L12996] ephedrine nasal spray is and OTC medication used as a decongestant.[L12993]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
