A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| PD | Tfelt-Hansen_2019 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The paper is a qualitative review discussing the delay of effect and comparing time to maximum effect (Emax) with Tmax, but it does not provide numeric concentration-effect parameters (like EC50 or slope) or a quantitative PD model for eletriptan. |
| popPK | Tokuoka_2015 | irrelevant | 2 | 1 | The paper is a theoretical analysis of receptor occupancy and headache recurrence using PK data from other studies, rather than a primary PK study reporting quantitative disposition parameters like clearance or volume for eletriptan. |
| popPK | Valetti_2022 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The study focuses on in vitro and ex vivo transmucosal delivery and permeation mechanisms, not on quantitative pharmacokinetic disposition parameters (CL, V, ka) in a biological system. |
| popPK | unknown_2002 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The paper is a clinical efficacy trial that mentions PK evaluations but does not report quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, ka, etc.) for eletriptan. |
