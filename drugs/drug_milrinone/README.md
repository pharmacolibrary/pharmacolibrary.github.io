## About

**Description.** Heart failure is a multifactorial condition that affects roughly 1-2% of the adult population. Often the result of long-term myocardial ischemia, cardiomyopathy, or other cardiac insults, heart failure results from an inability of the heart to perfuse peripheral tissues with sufficient oxygen and metabolites, resulting in complex systemic pathologies. Heart failure is underpinned by numerous physiological changes, including alteration in β-adrenergic signalling and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, which affects the heart's contractile function and cardiac output.[A228323] Milrinone is a second-generation bipyridine phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor created through chemical modification of [amrinone].[A228333] As a PDE-III inhibitor, milrinone results in increased cAMP levels and improves cardiac function and peripheral vasodilation in acute decongested heart failure.[A228338, A11759, A228323, A228333, A228348, L31483]

Milrinone was originally synthesized at the Sterling Winthrop Research Institute in the 1980s.[A228333] It was approved by the FDA on December 31, 1987, and was marketed under the trademark PRIMACOR® by Sanofi-Aventis US before being discontinued.[L31483]

**Indication.** Milrinone is indicated for the short-term (48 hours or less) treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Milrinone administration should occur together with close monitoring using appropriate electrocardiographic equipment and should occur in a facility equipped for the immediate treatment of potential cardiac events, including ventricular arrhythmias.[L31483]

The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
