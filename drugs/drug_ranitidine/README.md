## About

**Description.** Ranitidine is a commonly used drug, classified as a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, and belongs to the same drug class as [cimetidine] and [famotidine]. This drug helps to prevent and treat gastric-acid associated conditions, including ulcers, because of its ability to decrease gastric acid secretion.[A176759,L10818] Ranitidine is often referred to as Zantac, and is available in various forms, including tablet, injection, and effervescent tablet preparations.[L10818,F4253]

The prevalence of GERD is thought to be 10-20% in western countries.[A176843] Ranitidine has proven to be an effective treatment for relieving uncomfortable symptoms of gastric acid associated conditions and is therefore widely used in GERD and other gastric-acid related conditions.[A176849,L10818]

**Indication.** This drug is used alone or with concomitant antacids for the following conditions: short-term treatment of active duodenal ulcer, treating gastric acid hypersecretion due to Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, and other conditions that may pathologically raise gastric acid levels. It also used in the short term treatment of active benign gastric ulcers and maintenance therapy of gastric ulcers at a reduced dose. In addition to the above, ranitidine can be used for the treatment of GERD symptoms, treatment of erosive esophagitis (endoscopically diagnosed) and the maintenance of gastric or duodenal ulcer healing.[L10818,L10821]

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

| PGx | Schöller-Gyüre_2008 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates drug-drug interactions (etavirine with ranitidine/omeprazole) and excludes CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, rather than reporting a pharmacogenomic effect on ranitidine's PK/PD. |

| PD | Shimokawa_1996 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes neurotoxic convulsions in mice but does not report a pharmacodynamic exposure-response or dose-response relationship for ranitidine with numeric PD parameters. |

| PD | Soto_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on behavioral aversiveness in rats and does not report pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic modeling, exposure-response relationships, or numeric PD parameters for ranitidine. |
| popPK | Tadić_2008 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the pharmacological activities of hawthorn extract, using ranitidine only as a reference drug for gastroprotection, and contains no pharmacokinetic parameters for ranitidine. |
| PD | Tadić_2008 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies hawthorn berries extract; ranitidine is only mentioned as a reference drug for gastroprotection, and no PD or exposure-response relationship for ranitidine is reported. |
| PGx | Upton_1991 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper discusses drug-drug interactions affecting theophylline clearance and explicitly states that ranitidine was not found to influence theophylline disposition; it does not report pharmacogenomic effects on ranitidine. |
| PGx | Vernaz_2016 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper evaluates prescribing practices and costs for clopidogrel and esomeprazole, mentioning ranitidine only as a cost alternative, and does not report pharmacogenomic effects on ranitidine PK/PD. |
| PGx | Xiao_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a pharmacovigilance study analyzing adverse event reports (SCARs) and does not report pharmacogenomic effects on PK or PD parameters. |
| PGx | Xu_2017 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports genetic associations with FMO3 protein abundance in liver microsomes, but does not report pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters for ranitidine. |
