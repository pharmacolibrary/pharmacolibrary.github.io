## About

Spirapril is an ACE inhibitor used as an antihypertensive drug to treat high blood pressure. It is an approved medicine, but it does not appear to be widely marketed today and is not authorised in the European Union.

<small>Summary written by `glm-5.3-flash` from [Wikidata Q835757](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q835757) and the WHO ATC classification; not checked by a person.</small>

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
