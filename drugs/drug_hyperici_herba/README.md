<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PD | Alahmad_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the chemical identification of constituents and their in vitro antioxidant activities, not on pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic modeling in biological systems. |
| popPK | Boyle_2024 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The paper is a nursing review discussing St. John's wort in cancer care and does not report original quantitative pharmacokinetic parameter values. |
| popPK | Cheng_2023 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is a review of herb-drug interactions and does not report original quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters for hyperici_herba. |
| PD | Dimpfel_1997 | not_relevant | 2 | 0 | The paper describes qualitative EEG changes (delta/alpha waves) and trends in discriminant analysis but does not provide numeric concentration-effect data, dose-response curves, or specific PD parameters (Emax, EC50) that can be extracted. |
| popPK | Goey_2014 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (the subject drug) in the presence of St John's wort (hyperici_herba) as an interacting agent, rather than reporting PK parameters for hyperici_herba itself. |
| popPK | Izzo_2009 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of drug-herb interactions and does not report original quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, etc.) for hyperici_herba. |
| PD | Kladar_2020 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports in vitro enzyme inhibition (IC50) and antioxidant assays for various Hypericum samples, but does not contain any pharmacokinetic (PK) data, exposure-response analysis, or pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling. |
| popPK | Maideen_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of drug interactions involving adrenergic β-blockers, and St. John's wort (hyperici_herba) is only mentioned as a potential interacting herb without any quantitative PK parameters for it. |
| popPK | Mohammadinia_2018 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the effect of St. John's Wort on the clearance of a radiotracer (Tc-MIBI), not the pharmacokinetic parameters of St. John's Wort itself. |
| popPK | Nicolussi_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of drug-drug interactions where St. John's wort acts as an inducer of other drugs, not a study reporting quantitative PK parameters for hyperici_herba itself. |
| popPK | Tan_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a systematic review of warfarin interactions and does not report original quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters for hyperici_herba. |
| popPK | Wise_2019 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study relies on in silico predictions of phytochemical absorption timing (Tmax) rather than reporting quantitative population pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, Q, ka) for the drug hyperici_herba. |
