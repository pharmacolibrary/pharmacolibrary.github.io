## About

Acetyldigoxin is a digoxin derivative belonging to the cardiac glycoside group, a class of drugs used to treat heart conditions such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It appears to be only an experimental compound today, with no evidence of current authorisation or routine clinical use.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
