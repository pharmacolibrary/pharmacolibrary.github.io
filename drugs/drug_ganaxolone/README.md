## About

**Description.** Ganaxolone is the 3β-methylated synthetic analog of [allopregnanolone],[L41130] a metabolite of [progesterone].[A3197] Ganaxolone belongs to a class of compounds referred to as neurosteroids.[A3197] Endogenous neurosteroids, which comprise certain metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, bind potently and specifically to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to enhance their inhibitory effects, and are thus known to have anxiolytic, analgesic, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and anesthetic properties.[A245995]

Ganaxolone, similar to its endogenous counterparts, is a positive allosteric modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.[L41130] It was approved under the brand name ZTALMY by the US FDA in March 2022 for the treatment of seizures associated with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), becoming the first FDA-approved treatment indicated specifically for CDD.[L41135] In July 2023, ganaxolone was also approved under the same brand name and for the same indication by the EMA.[L47636]

**Indication.** Ganaxolone is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) in patients ≥2 years old by the FDA.[L41130] It is also approved as an adjuvant treatment for the same condition in patients aged 2 to 17, although it may be continued in patients 18 years old or older, by the EMA.[L47631]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
