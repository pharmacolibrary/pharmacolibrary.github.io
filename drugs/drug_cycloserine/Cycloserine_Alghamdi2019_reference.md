<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section residual_error: 'Proportional' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual error parameter')
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): '−2LL' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T2:row2:col1', 'T2:row2:col2'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'vs HS' (CL)
- dropped duplicate Q83 ('ω, Tlag', value '0.409') — already have one for this compound
- routed 'ω, ka' → Q314 (omega_cov) to covariance — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- routed 'ω, V/F' → Q314 (omega_cov) to covariance — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('ω, CL/F', value '0.353') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('γ, CL/F', value '0.190') — already have one for this compound
- covariate effect for Q26 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=cycloserine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell T2:row9:col3 = '&lt;0.0001'
- unparsed cell T2:row10:col3 = '&lt;0.0001'
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
