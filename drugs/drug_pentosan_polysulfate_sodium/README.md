## About

Pentosan polysulfate sodium is a heparin-like drug used as an anticoagulant and, in urology, to treat bladder conditions such as interstitial cystitis. It is an approved medicine, used mainly in urological care, and is also being studied for other conditions.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
