## About

**Description.** Picosulfuric acid is found in laxative products. Sodium picosulfate is a used to treat constipation or induce colon cleansing to prepare the large bowels before colonoscopy or surgery. The combination product containing sodium picosulfate and magnesium citrate was introduced to the Canadian market in 2005 and has been used in European countries for many years.[A33322]

**Indication.** Sodium picosulfate, in combination with magnesium oxide and anhydrous citric acid, is indicated for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in adults and pediatric patients ages 9 years and older.[L43832]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
