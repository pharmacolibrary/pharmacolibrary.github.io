## About

**Description.** Bromopride is a dopamine antagonist used as an antiemetic. Its prokinetic properties are similar to those of metoclopramide. It is unavailable in America or the United Kingdom.

**Indication.** Bromopride in indicated in the treatment of nausea and vomiting, including PONV (post-operative nausea and vomiting), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD/GORD), as well as endoscopy preparation and radiographic studies of the GI tract.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
