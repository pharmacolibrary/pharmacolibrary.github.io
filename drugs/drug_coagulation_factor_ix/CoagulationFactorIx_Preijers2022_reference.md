A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for coagulation factor ix's clearance, volume of distribution, central→peripheral rate constant and peripheral→central rate constant — all 17 extracted parameters describe N9-GP, rFIXFc and rIX-FP, not coagulation factor ix; the covariate scenarios were not simulated.**

The model was built, but coagulation factor ix's clearance, volume of distribution, central→peripheral rate constant and peripheral→central rate constant had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. The base model was simulated, not the covariate effects the record defines. A reported unit could not be converted (CL, CL, CL and V1), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — N9-GP: CL 4.6 CL; mLh−1, V1 4.8 V1; mL, Q2 35.2, V2 11.8 V2; mL, t1/2z 94.3 h; rFIXFc: CL 239 CL; mLh−1, V1 7.14e+03 V1; mL, Q2 167, V2 8.7e+03 V2; mL, Q3 3.93e+03 Q3; mLh−1, V3 3.99e+03 V3; mL, t1/2z 79 h; rIX-FP: CL 57 CL; mLh−1, V1 6.48e+03 V1; mL, Q2 29, V2 1.58e+03 V2; mL, t1/2z 108 h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has extended half-life factor IX concentrates, the second reading N9-GP, rFIXFc, rIX-FP. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `extended half-life factor IX concentrates`, measured `factor IX`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'n9-gpa' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- column 'rfixfcb' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- column 'rix-fpc' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'CL; mLh−1' (CL)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'V1; mL' (V1)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'V2; mL' (V2)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'Q3; mLh−1' (Q3)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'V3; mL' (V3)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Baseline FIX level' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab1:row9:col5', 'Tab1:row9:col6'])
- routed 'Correlation between CL and V1 (%)' → Q314 (omega_cov) to covariance — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- covariate effect for Q319 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=factor IX
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- structure disagreement: deterministic 2C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures 'factor IX', not coagulation_factor_ix — the review values are the parent's
