## About

Sucralfate is an anti-ulcer medicine used to treat stomach and duodenal ulcers, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophagitis, and related mouth and gut conditions. It is an approved drug, widely used for acid-related digestive disorders, though it is not authorised centrally in the European Union.
