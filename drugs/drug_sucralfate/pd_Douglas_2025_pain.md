<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** White cell count drives pain score (in score (0-10)): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Pain score (0–10) is described by a sigmoid Emax model in which rising white cell count (a surrogate for neutrophil recovery) reduces pain via a delayed (effect-compartment) link with an equilibration half-time of 0.29 days; the WCC giving 50% of maximum pain reduction (ED50) was 0.25 × 10^9/L with Hill exponent 1.84, E0 6.4 (paper text 6.3) and EMAX 0.58 (paper text 59%). Morphine (ED50 8.3 μg/kg/h, HILLm 0.13, EMAX 0.38) and ketamine (ED50 1.5 mg/kg/h, HILLk 0.26, EMAX 0.11) act as additional multiplicative fractional pain reductions.
