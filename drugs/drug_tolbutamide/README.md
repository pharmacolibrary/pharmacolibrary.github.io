## About

Tolbutamide is a sulfonylurea blood-glucose-lowering drug used to treat type 2 diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2, and it also serves as a diagnostic agent in tests for diabetes. It is an approved medication, though it is not authorised in the European Union.

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
