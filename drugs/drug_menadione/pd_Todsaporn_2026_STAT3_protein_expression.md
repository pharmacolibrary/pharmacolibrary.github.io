<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Unknown drives name (in ratio) (inhibition; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> The paper does not describe a menadione–STAT3 model; it reports naphthalene-based compounds (2q, 2s, 2d) that directly inhibit JAK2 kinase activity in a dose–response (IC50) format, with 2q the most potent (IC50 = 12.25 ± 1.07 nM), followed by 2s (18.84 ± 0.92 nM) and 2d (40.47 ± 2.54 nM), versus ruxolitinib (22.35 ± 3.58 nM). Consistently, 2q and 2s reduced JAK2 protein expression dose- and time-dependently (e.g., 2q: 27.54–98.12% reduction at 1×–2× IC50 over 24–48 h), while JAK1 was only modestly affected; no Emax, kin/kout, or ke0 values are given.
