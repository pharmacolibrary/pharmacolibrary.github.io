## About

**Description.** Nebivolol is a racemic mixture of 2 enantiomers where one is a beta adrenergic antagonist and the other acts as a cardiac stimulant without beta adrenergic activity.[A182579] Treatment with nebivolol leads to a greater decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than [atenolol], [propranolol], or [pindolol].[A182579] Nebivolol and other beta blockers are generally not first line therapies as many patients are first treated with thiazide diuretics.[A182594]

Nebivolol was granted FDA approval on 17 December 2007.[L7985]

**Indication.** Nebivolol is indicated to treat hypertension.[A2762,A182579,L7985,L7988]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| PD | Gschwend_2009 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The study reports pharmacodynamic effects (endothelial relaxation) at fixed doses but does not provide concentration-effect data, PK parameters, or a fitted PD model with numeric parameters like EC50 or slope. |
| popPK | Kannan_2012 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a zebrafish cardiovascular screening assay where nebivolol is used only as a positive control for heart rate and blood flow, not for pharmacokinetic parameter estimation. |
| PD | Kannan_2012 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | Nebivolol is used only as a single-dose positive control for comparison; no dose-response curve or numeric PD parameters (EC50, Emax) are reported for nebivolol. |
| popPK | Okamoto_2014 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | This is a pharmacodynamic blood-pressure study, not a PK study, and no nebivolol disposition parameters are reported. |
