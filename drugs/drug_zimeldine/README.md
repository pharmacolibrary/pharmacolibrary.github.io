## About

Zimeldine was an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class, used to treat depression. It was later withdrawn from the market after being linked to serious neurological adverse reactions, so it is no longer used.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
