## About

Salicylamide is a salicylic acid derivative used as an analgesic and antipyretic to treat pain and fever. It is an approved drug, but it is not widely used today and has largely been replaced by other salicylate painkillers.

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.
