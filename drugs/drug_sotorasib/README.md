The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Hossain_2025 | irrelevant | 2 | 2 | The paper presents a novel mass spectrometry method for covalent drug development using sotorasib as a validation case, reporting qualitative mechanism of action and target engagement metrics, but it does not provide quantitative population-pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, Vd, Q, ka) for sotorasib. |
| popPK | Modest_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | This is a clinical trial reporting patient-reported outcomes (quality of life) and does not contain pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance or volume. |
| popPK | Nagase_2025 | relevant | 10 | 2 | The paper describes a population PK model for sotorasib, but specific numeric parameter values (CL, V, etc.) are not present in the provided abstract text. |
