<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Ipragliflozin drives FPG (in mg/dL): delayed effect through an effect compartment.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Ipragliflozin's effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was modeled with an Emax model driven by predicted 24-h urinary glucose excretion (ΔUGE24h, in g/24 h) entering an effect compartment (Keq = 0.283/week, ~12 weeks to maximum response), rather than by drug exposure; the effect is inhibitory (glucose-lowering) with a population Emax of 45.3 mg/dL at reference baseline FPG 162 mg/dL (Emax scaling ~25% larger per 10% higher baseline FPG) and EC50 = 39.4 g/24 h (IIV 277% CV).

## Models

<p>No downloads: this record is <b>rejected</b>, so it is not published as a model. Any archives generated for it before the verdict have been removed — a download outlives the page that explains it.</p>

<div class="pk-tab-mark" data-tab="Simulation"></div>

_No web simulator for this record: its structure has no shared WebAssembly template. The FMI archive under **Models** carries its own compiled FMU._
