<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Fluindione drives INR (in unknown): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of INR.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Fluindione plasma concentrations act on INR via an indirect response model in which fluindione inhibits the production of the INR response (Hill/Emax inhibition function), with turnover governed by I0 = 1.10 (hr⁻¹) and kout = 0.03 hr⁻¹; potency parameters are IC50 = 2.18 mg/L, Imax = 0.94 and Hill coefficient γ = 1.71 (surgery lowers IC50 and γ, with β IC50,surgery = -0.54 and β γ,surgery = -0.46).
