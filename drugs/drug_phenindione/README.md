## About

Phenindione is an anticoagulant of the vitamin K antagonist type, used to prevent and treat unwanted blood clotting. It is an approved medicine, though it is not authorised in the European Union and is now little used compared with newer anticoagulants.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
