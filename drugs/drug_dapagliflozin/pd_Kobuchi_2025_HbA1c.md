<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Dapagliflozin (concentrations from this paper's PK model) drives HbA1c (in %): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of HbA1c.

**Model:** A model was generated (see the **Models** tab); it has no in-browser simulator.

> Dapagliflozin plasma concentration (ng/mL) drives an indirect response (turnover) model of HbA1c (%), in which dapagliflozin inhibits HbA1c production (glycation) via an Emax function (with a lower boundary correction at 5.0%); final-model estimates were Emax 0.034 HbA1c %/day (3.1 for the baseline-corrected component), EC50 23.7 ng/mL (5.8 ng/mL for the second component), and HbA1c half-life t1/2 16.1 day (4.1 day), with inter-individual variability in t1/2 of 103.9%.

Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Exposure-response model

`Dapagliflozin_Kobuchi2025_PD_hba1c` — turnover (indirect response type I), `response = E0*(1 - Emax*frac)`

| parameter | value (paper units) | SI |
|---|---|---|
| E0 | 0 | — |
| Emax | 0.034 | — |
| EC50 | 23.7 ng/mL | 2.37e-05 kg/m3 |
| gamma | 1 | — |

Closed-form check points (response, SI): `at_0` = 0, `at_EC50` = 0, `at_inf` = 0

Deviations:

- `defaulted_parameters` — E0, gamma

## Review

Verdict <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span> · route to `scholar`

| check | status | note |
|---|---|---|
| `T0_driver` | pass | driver is the drug, a synonym or one of its metabolites (or unnamed) |
| `T1_closed_form` | pass | engineer's check points reproduced from the bound parameters |
| `T1b_fmu` | skipped | template FMU / fmpy not available — advisory only |
| `T2_direction` | skipped | effect_direction 'inhibition' |
| `T3_plausibility` | pass | EC50, gamma, Imax and baseline in range |
| `T4_defaults` | fail | a core parameter took a library default: E0 |

Advisory:

- defaulted: E0 — a row the paper has and the record lacks
