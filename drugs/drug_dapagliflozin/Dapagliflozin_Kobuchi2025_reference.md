**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**The dapagliflozin model was held back because clearance, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time had no source values, so placeholder numbers stood in for them, including an invented ka.**

The record lists ka as 57.4 1/day, but the model builder defaulted ka because it was not reported in the source, and likewise left dapagliflozin's clearance and absorption lag time without values, substituting placeholder defaults rather than the paper's numbers. The parameterization is apparent (F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction). Covariate effects defined in the record (e.g. θBW on clearance) were not exercised in simulation — only the reference individual was simulated. A second reader also disagrees on t1/2z (16.1 vs 15.3 day) and θBW (0.41 vs 0.22). Extracted — dapagliflozin: t1/2z 16.1 day, kabs 57.4, V/F 73.9 L.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[t1/2hba1c].value`: this record has 16.1, the second reading 15.3; it also differs on 2 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

**Model structure:** 1-compartment, oral mammillary model — template `PK_1C_enteral`.  
**Parameters:** 3 extracted.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `model_quarantined`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Parameters' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T3:row0:col4', 'T3:row0:col5'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Emax (HbA1c %/day)' → Q320 (Emax, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['T3:row4:col1', 'T3:row4:col2', 'T3:row4:col4', 'T3:row4:col5'])
- dropped PD-category row 'EC50 (ng/mL)' → Q321 (EC50, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['T3:row5:col1', 'T3:row5:col2', 'T3:row5:col4', 'T3:row5:col5'])
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('ωt1/2 HbA1c (%)', value '103.9') — already have one for this compound
- kept covariate coefficient θBW=0.41 (covariate BW) — not an ontology parameter
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ωCL/F (%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Kobuchi_2025_table_2:row8:col1', 'Kobuchi_2025_table_2:row8:col2', 'Kobuchi_2025_table_2:row8:col4', 'Kobuchi_2025_table_2:row8:col5'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=dapagliflozin
- bound model equation to Q27 (CL/F): CL/F = θCL/F* (BW/77.0)^θBW
- Q27 (CL/F) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'θCL/F (L/day)'; equation kept verbatim
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- companion parameter table 2 transcribed (20 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2, 3
- captured model equation CL/F = θCL/F* (BW/77.0)^θBW
