## About

Flosequinan is a vasodilator that was used to treat heart failure. It has been withdrawn from the market and is no longer used, reportedly because of safety concerns in patients with heart failure.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
