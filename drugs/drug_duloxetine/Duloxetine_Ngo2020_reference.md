A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

> **Species: rat.** This record comes from an animal study (rat), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 0.99).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The duloxetine parent–metabolite model was rejected because 4-hydroxy duloxetine is an unlinked metabolite: no usable path from duloxetine to the metabolite compartment could be established.**

The record describes duloxetine with absorption rate constant kabs 1.35, clearance CL 1.97, peripheral volume V2 14.6, and a presystemic plus systemic metabolism to 4-hydroxy duloxetine, whose apparent clearance CLm/F is 12.3 and apparent volume Vm/F is 84.2. Although a metabolism link from duloxetine to 4-hydroxy duloxetine via the rate constant Kfm is recorded, the structure check found the metabolite side unreachable from the dose, so the model was refused. No numeric comparison could be computed for this finding (ratio None), and no other failed checks are reported. Extracted — duloxetine: kabs 1.35, CL 1.97, V2 14.6; 4-hydroxy duloxetine: CLm/F 12.3, Vm/F 84.2.

**Model structure:** parent + metabolite; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 5 extracted, plus 6 covariate effects.

**Parameterization:** CLm/F, Vm/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- compound tags: 10 row(s) → 4-hydroxy duloxetine (m_suffix 10)
- column 'unit' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- column 'estimates rse (%)' classified 'rse' by the LLM but kept as the estimate: the header names the point value
- dropped value-less row: 'Parameters'
- covariate level 'F pm' → Q900:f_pm = 0.589 (linear_fractional on the model)
- routed 'Prop_p' → Q316 (prop_error) to residual_error — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- routed 'Prop_m' → Q316 (prop_error) to residual_error — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- dropped value-less row: 'RSE'
- dropped value-less row: 'CI'
