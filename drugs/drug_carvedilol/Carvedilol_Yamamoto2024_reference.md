A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The paper reports none of the model's key parameters.**

No clearance, volume or rate constant of the model is reported in it. No parameter values were extracted.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has rac-carvedilol, the second reading carvedilol (racemic); it also differs on 2 more fields. That field does not shape the model.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `rac-carvedilol`, measured `(S)-carvedilol`.

**Model structure:** general linear; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 9 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column '(s)-carvedilol final model estimate (rse %)' classified 'rse' by the LLM but kept as the estimate: the header names the point value
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('ka_2_pop', value '0.57') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'F1_pop' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Yamamoto_2024_table_1:row2:col4'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'RYGB on F1' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Yamamoto_2024_table_1:row3:col4'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'TIag2_pop' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Yamamoto_2024_table_1:row4:col4'])
- dropped duplicate Q87 ('BIO2', value '0.13') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q95 ('θka2', value '0.21') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q40 ('θF1', value '0.79') — already have one for this compound
- kept covariate coefficient θTIag2=0.84 (covariate TIag2) — not an ontology parameter
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('θCL', value '0.56') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q63 ('θV1', value '1.17') — already have one for this compound
- kept covariate coefficient θQ=0.7 (covariate Q) — not an ontology parameter
- dropped duplicate Q64 ('θV2', value '1.42') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Proportional (b)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Yamamoto_2024_table_1:row24:col4'])
- dropped PD-category row 'baseline effect (E 0 )' → Q324 (E0, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['fig_5:caption'])
- dropped PD-category row 'E max' → Q320 (Emax, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['fig_5:caption'])
- dropped PD-category row 'concentration at 50% of the E max (EC 50 )' → Q321 (EC50, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['fig_5:caption'])
- unit inherited for Fab (Q40): 'fixed' from a same-Q-code sibling (this row's label had no unit)
- implicit units: 'ka_1_pop' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'Absorption rate constants (ka) are first-order rate constants, conventionally expressed in reciprocal time units (1/h). ')
- implicit units: 'Cl_pop' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'Clearance (Cl) is conventionally expressed in volume per time (L/h). The value 17.29 is consistent with L/h for a drug l')
- implicit units: 'V1_pop' → L (from the popPK convention: 'Volume of distribution (V1) is conventionally expressed in volume units (L). The value 4.96 is consistent with L.')
- implicit units: 'Q_pop' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'Intercompartmental clearance (Q) is conventionally expressed in volume per time (L/h). The value 12.54 is consistent wit')
- implicit units: 'V2_pop' → L (from the popPK convention: 'Volume of distribution (V2) is conventionally expressed in volume units (L). The value 140.65 is consistent with L.')
- implicit units: 'θka1' → h (from the popPK convention: 'Half-life (t1/2) is a time parameter, conventionally expressed in hours (h). The value 0.21 is consistent with h.')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=(S)-carvedilol
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- model-stage split: '(s)-carvedilol final model estimate (rse %)' is the final model of Yamamoto_2024 (paper reports 2 stages: (r)-carvedilol final model estimate (rse %), (s)-carvedilol final model estimate (rse %)); same population, different model-building step
- molar mass: none of 1 PubChem candidate(s) is '(S)-carvedilol' (LLM) — left in mass units
- molar mass: none found for '(S)-carvedilol' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- text-pointer recovery: parsed 0 structural record(s) from the flattened table 1 sentence
- LLM region Yamamoto_2024:results_prose: no JSON records returned
