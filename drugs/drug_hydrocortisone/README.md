## About

Hydrocortisone, a glucocorticoid steroid hormone, is used as an anti-inflammatory medicine for conditions such as adrenal insufficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, ulcerative colitis, asthma attacks, and various skin, eye, and ear inflammations. It is widely used and appears on the WHO essential medicines list, with authorised products in the European Union and approved veterinary uses.

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
