## About

**Description.** Hydrocortisone, or cortisol, is a glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex.[A188387] Hydrocortisone is used to treat immune, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions.[L10529,L10532,L10535,L10538,L7772,L7321] It was discovered in the 1930s by Edward Kendall and named Compound F, or 17-hydroxycorticosterone.[A188420]

Hydrocortisone was granted FDA approval on 5 August 1952.[L10574]

**Indication.** Otic solutions are indicated for infections of the external auditory canal caused by susceptible organisms and with inflammation.[L10529,L10532] Hydrocortisone tablets are indicated for certain endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, allergic, ophthalmic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, gastrointestinal, and other conditions.[L10535] A hydrocortisone enema is indicated for ulcerative colitis,[L10538] a topical ointment with antibiotics is indicated for corticosteroid responsive dermatoses with infections,[L7772] and a topical cream with [acyclovir] is indicated to treat cold sores.[L7321] Oral granules of hydrocortisone are used as a replacement therapy for Adrenocortical Insufficiency (AI) in children under 17 years of age.[L16533]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
