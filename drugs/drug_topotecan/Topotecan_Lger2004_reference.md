**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for topotecan's clearance and volume of distribution; the covariate scenarios were not simulated.**

The model was built, but topotecan's clearance and volume of distribution had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. The base model was simulated, not the covariate effects the record defines. A reported unit could not be converted (CL and V), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — topotecan: CL 62 1−θ3 × PS, V 27 1−θ3 × PS.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'δobjd' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped value-less row: 'CL(l h−1)=(θ1+θ2 × CrCl) × (1−θ3 × PS)' (captured trailing unit '1−θ3 × PS' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'Interday variability of CL'
- dropped value-less row: 'Central volume: V1 (l)=θ4 × body weight'
- dropped value-less row: 'Interday variability of V1'
- dropped value-less row: 'Peripheral volume: V2 (l)=θ5'
- dropped value-less row: 'Intercompartmental clearance: Q(l h−1)=θ6'
- dropped value-less row: 'Interday variability of F'
- dropped value-less row: 'Constant rate of absorption: Ka(h−1)=θ9'
- dropped value-less row: 'Lag time (h)=θ10'
- unit '1−θ3 × PS' inherited from a section-header row for CL (not printed on this row itself) — see the unit_dimension_mismatch check below if this is wrong
- unit_dimension_unknown: '1−θ3 × PS' (CL)
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('CL=θ1 × (1−θ3 × PS)', value '+47') — already have one for this compound
- unit '1−θ3 × PS' inherited from a section-header row for V1 (not printed on this row itself) — see the unit_dimension_mismatch check below if this is wrong
- unit_dimension_unknown: '1−θ3 × PS' (V1)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=topotecan
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- 1C volume normalization: Q63→Q61 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'V1=θ4' is the general volume)
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
