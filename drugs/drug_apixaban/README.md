## About

**Description.** Apixaban is an oral, direct, and highly selective factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor of both free and bound FXa, as well as prothrombinase, independent of antithrombin III for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases[Label,A6897]. It is marketed under the name Eliquis[Label,L6043]. Apixaban was approved by the FDA on December 28, 2012[L6043].

**Indication.** Apixaban is indicated for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients who have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis(DVT) leading to pulmonary embolism(PE) in patients after a hip or knee replacement surgery, and treatment of DVT and PE to reduce the risk of recurrence[Label,A177565,A6897].

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
