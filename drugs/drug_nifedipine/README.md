## About

**Description.** Nifedipine, or BAY a 1040, is a first generation dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker, similar to [nicardipine].[A190210,A190273,A175390,L11383] Nifedipine was developed by Bayer and first described in the literature, along with other dihydropyridines, in 1972.[A175390,A190276] Since nifedipine's development, second and third generation dihydropyridines have been developed with slower onsets and longer durations of action.[A190273] The most popular of the third generation dihydropyridines is [amlodipine].[A190273]

Nifedipine was granted FDA approval on 31 December 1981.[L11383]

**Indication.** Nifedipine capsules are indicated to treat vasospastic angina and chronic stable angina.[L11383] Extended release tablets are indicated to treat vasospastic angina, chronic stable angina, and hypertension.[L11389,L1245]

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
