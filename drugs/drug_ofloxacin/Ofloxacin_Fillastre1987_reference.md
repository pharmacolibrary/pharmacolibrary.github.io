**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**Ofloxacin's clearance, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time were not reported, so library placeholder values were substituted and the model was quarantined; a second reader also disputes the clearance value (241.4 vs 49.2 ml/min per 1.73 m2).**

The record for ofloxacin in subjects with renal failure and healthy controls lacks source values for clearance, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time, so placeholder values stood in for these parameters and the model was held back rather than published with invented numbers. The clearance unit (ml/min per 1.73 m2) could not be converted to SI, so clearance reached the model builder without an SI value. A second reader reads total body clearance as 49.2 rather than 241.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and the model assumes F=1 and Fm=1 with no molar correction. Extracted — ofloxacin: V/F 2.53 liters/kg, CL/F 241 ml/min per 1.73 m2, CL 241 ml/min per 1.73 m2, kabs 2.9 h-i.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[total body clearance].value`: this record has 241.4, the second reading 49.2. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.
