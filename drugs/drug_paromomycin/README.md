The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Chu_2026 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study reports skin-to-plasma ratios and PK/PD outcomes rather than standard quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, ka) for paromomycin. |
| popPK | Donegatti_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes an analytical method (CZE-UV) for quantifying paromomycin in formulations and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| PD | Donegatti_2020 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes a chromatographic analytical method (CZE-UV) for quantifying aminoglycosides and mentions a controlled release experiment fitted with a Hill equation, but it does not report any pharmacodynamic (exposure-response or dose-response) relationship or PD parameters for paromomycin. |
| popPK | Fatma_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic investigation of paromomycin as an antiviral agent, reporting no pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| popPK | Ferreira_2022 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro drug susceptibility assay for Leishmania isolates, not a pharmacokinetic study, and reports no PK parameters for paromomycin. |
| popPK | Kangussu-Marcolino_2022 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro drug screening study for Entamoeba histolytica where paromomycin is only mentioned as part of the standard treatment regimen, with no pharmacokinetic data reported. |
| PD | Kangussu-Marcolino_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on drug repurposing screening for Entamoeba histolytica and does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response data for paromomycin. |
| popPK | Paixão_2018 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | Paromomycin is used only as an external reference marker for validation, not as the subject of PK parameter estimation, and no quantitative PK values are provided in the evidence. |
| popPK | Rayamajhi_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a toxicological assessment of antibiotics on algae, not a pharmacokinetic study, and reports no disposition parameters for paromomycin. |
| popPK | Schupfner_2013 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in vitro efficacy assessment of anti-cryptosporidial drugs where paromomycin serves only as a comparator, with no pharmacokinetic parameters reported. |
| popPK | Seifert_2006 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on in vitro and in vivo drug interactions (efficacy) of miltefosine with paromomycin, not on the pharmacokinetic disposition parameters of paromomycin. |
| PD | Seifert_2006 | not_relevant | 3 | 2 | The paper reports in vitro interaction indices (FICs) and in vivo activity enhancement indices (AEI) for drug combinations, but does not provide a pharmacodynamic model (e.g., Emax, EC50) or exposure-response relationship for paromomycin alone. |

| PD | Seifert_2011 | not_relevant | 3 | 2 | The paper reports in vitro drug interaction data (FICs) and mentions EC50/EC90 levels for classification, but does not provide the specific numeric concentration-effect curves or PD parameters for paromomycin alone or in combination that would allow derivation of a quantitative PD relationship. |
| popPK | Zhang_2009 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the antiviral activity of geneticin against dengue virus, with paromomycin mentioned only as a comparator with weak activity, and no pharmacokinetic parameters are reported. |
| PD | Zhang_2009 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper reports PD parameters (EC50, EC90) for geneticin, not paromomycin; paromomycin is only mentioned qualitatively as having weak activity. |
