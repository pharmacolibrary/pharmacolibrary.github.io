## About

**Description.** Fidaxomicin is a novel macrolide antibiotic used in the treatment of diarrhea caused by _Clostridioides_ (formerly _Clostridium_) _difficile_ in adult and pediatric patients over the age of 6 months.[L11575] Fidaxomicin is a naturally-occurring 18-member macrocycle derived from fermentation.[A190501] Because fidaxomicin contains an 18-membered lactone ring in its structure, it is referred to as a macrocyclic lactone antibiotic drug.[A190492] The antibacterial activity of fidaxomicin is distinct from macrolides and rifamycins, as the bactericidal activity is time-dependent, and not concentration-dependent.[A190492] Fidaxomicin was the first macrocyclic lactone antibiotic with activity against _C. difficile_,[A190486] and it displays a narrow spectrum of activity against gram-positive anaerobes.[A7445] It mediates its potent bactericidal action on the bacteria by inhibiting the bacterial RNA synthase, thereby disrupting bacterial transcription.[A190486] The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC<sub>90</sub>) for fidaxomicin is four times less than that of [vancomycin], which was the primary drug of choice for _C. difficile_ infection before the approval of fidaxomicin.[A190492] Unlike vancomycin, however, fidaxomicin has a negligible effect on normal colonic microflora.[A190516]

The FDA initially approved fidaxomicin in May 2011 for the treatment of _C. difficile_-associated diarrhea in adult patients over the age of 18.[A190492] Later that year in December, the drug was also approved by the European Medicine Agency.[A190492] In June 2012, fidaxomicin was also granted approval by Health Canada.[A190486] The approved indication of fidaxomicin was expanded by the FDA in January 2020 to include pediatric patients over the age of 6 months in the treatment population.[L11575]

**Indication.** Fidaxomicin is indicated for the treatment of _Clostridioides_ (formerly _Clostridium_) _difficile_-associated diarrhea in adult and pediatric patients 6 months of age and older.[L11575]

Fidaxomicin should only be used in patients with proven or strongly suspected _C. difficile_ infection to reduce the risk of development of drug-resistant bacteria and maximize the therapeutic effectiveness of fidaxomicin and other antimicrobial agents.[L11575]

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
