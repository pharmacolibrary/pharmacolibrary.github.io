## About

**Description.** Maralixibat (also known as SHP625, LUM001, and lopixibat) is an ileal bile acid transporter inhibitor, like [odevixibat].[A236823,A239249,L38834] Maralixibat is indicated for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome.[L38834]

Previously, patients with cholestatic pruritus associated with Alagille syndrome were treated with antihistamines, [rifampin], [ursodeoxycholic acid], [cholestyramine], [naltrexone], and [sertraline] alone or in combination.[A239249] No clinical trials have been performed to assess the efficacy of these treatments for cholestatic pruritus and treatments were given based on a prescriber's clinical experience.[A239249] Surgical interventions such as partial external bile diversion and ileal exclusion have also been used as treatments.[A239249]

Maralixibat represents the first FDA-approved treatment for cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome. It was granted FDA approval on 29 September 2021.[L38834] In October 2022, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended maralixibat be granted marketing authorization for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome:[L43547] it was granted marketing authorization in Europe on 13 December 2022.[L44396] On July 21, 2023, maralixibat was also approved by Health Canada.[L47541]

**Indication.** Maralixibat is indicated in the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome.[L38834] This indication is approved for use in patients at least one month old in the US [L38834] and at least two months old in Europe.[L44391] In Canada, it is reserved for of patients at least 12 months old.[L47541]

In the US, maralixibat is also indicated for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients 5 years of age and older with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC).[L50401] In the EU, it is approved for the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients 3 months and older.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Billo_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro mechanistic study analyzing transporter inhibition (IC50) and cross-reactivity, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting disposition parameters like clearance or volume. |
| popPK | Carreño_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on linerixibat (a different drug) and models C4 concentrations, not maralixibat pharmacokinetics. |
| popPK | de_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | This is a systematic review of clinical efficacy (pruritus and serum bile acids) and dose-response, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting quantitative disposition parameters like clearance or volume. |
| PD | de_2026 | not_relevant | 3 | 2 | The paper is a systematic review that qualitatively assesses dose-response relationships but explicitly concludes that no evident dose-response relationship was observed, and it does not provide numeric PD parameters (e.g., Emax, EC50) or a quantitative effect-vs-concentration curve. |
