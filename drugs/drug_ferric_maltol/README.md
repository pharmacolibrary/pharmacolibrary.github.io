## About

**Description.** Ferric maltol is an iron(III) atom complexed with 3 maltol molecules to increase the bioavailability compared to iron(II), without depositing it in the duodenum as insoluble ferric hydroxide and phosphate.[A189288] Ferric maltol has been described in literature since at least the late 1980s as a potential treatment for iron deficiency.[A189291]

Ferric maltol was initially granted FDA approval on July 25, 2019, for use in adults. [L10974] On December 22, 2025, the FDA expanded this indication to include pediatric patients aged 10 years and older. [L54873,L54878]

**Indication.** Ferric maltol is indicated for the treatment of iron deficiency in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older.[L10974,L54873]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
