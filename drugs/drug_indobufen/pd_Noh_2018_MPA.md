<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** S-indobufen and R-indobufen (measured concentrations) drive platelet aggregation inhibition (in %): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> In vitro, S- and R-indobufen concentrations (0–128 mg/L) inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation (MPA, %) in platelet-rich plasma from 24 healthy subjects, described by an inhibitory sigmoid Imax response-surface model with no enantiomer interaction (ISR fixed at 0). S-indobufen was more potent (C50 6.75 mg/L, RSE 26.8%) than R-indobufen (C50 48.7 mg/L, RSE 3.6%), with Imax 6.38 (RSE 28.8%); the paper does not state gamma, kin/kout, or ke0 values.

Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.
