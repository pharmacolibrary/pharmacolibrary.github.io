## About

**Description.** Nelarabine is an antineoplastic agent that is typically used to treat acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, particularly T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL), in both adult and pediatric patients whose disease has not responded to or has relapsed following at least two chemotherapy regimens.[L40878] T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma are relatively rare T-cells malignancy, with only 20 to 25% of patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 1.7% of patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma having this T-cells variation of the disease.[A2332] Due to the rarity of these T-cell malignancies, nelarabine was first granted orphan drug status and a fast-track designation by the FDA to address the unmet therapeutic needs of these cancers.[A2331]

Nelarabine is a purine nucleoside analog converted to its corresponding arabinosylguanine nucleotide triphosphate (araGTP), resulting in the inhibition of DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity.[L40878] Nelarabine preferentially accumulates in T-cells since T-cells have a higher expression of enzymes that convert nelarabine to the active purine analog form, making them effective against T-cells malignancies.[A2331,AA2334,A2335] Results from 2 phase 2 studies on adult and pediatric T-ALL/T-LBL indicated that nelarabine can yield a 13% complete response (CR) rate in pediatric patients and 18% in adult patients, albeit with serious hematological and neurological adverse events.[A258719]

Nelarabine was first granted accelerated approval by the FDA on October 28, 2005, and was manufactured under the trademark name ARRANON by GlaxoSmithKline.[A15220] Subsequently, nelarabine was also approved by both Health Canada and European Medicines Agency in 2007 under the trademark name ATRIANCE.[L45874,L45879]

**Indication.** ARRANON is indicated for the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) in adult and pediatric patients age 1 year and older whose disease has not responded to or has relapsed following treatment with at least two chemotherapy regimens.[L40878]

One record per gene, so a paper reporting several genes appears on several rows.</td></tr><tr><td><code>affects</code></td><td>the PK or PD parameter the genotype SHIFTS, as an ontology Q-code plus its name — Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F (apparent clearance), Q32 = Cmax, Q88 = AUC, Q40 = Fab, Q321 = EC50, Q322 = IC50, Q305 = kfm. The record's per-phenotype theta is a multiplier ON that parameter: a poor-metaboliser theta shifts this value, it does not supply one. Two values are NOT parameters — Q100 (NIL) is an association or risk finding with no parameter target, and `safety` is an adverse-reaction risk such as an HLA allele. A PA… id instead of a Q-code marks a record derived from a ClinPGx/PharmGKB guideline lookup rather than read out of the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>mechanism</code></td><td>how the gene acts: metabolism, transport, target, formation, safety_allele, or unknown.</td></tr><tr><td><code>detail</code></td><td>the paper stem, linking to the full record page.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
