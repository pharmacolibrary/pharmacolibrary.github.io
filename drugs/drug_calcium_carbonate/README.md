## About

**Description.** Calcium carbonate is an inorganic salt used as an antacid. It is a basic compound that acts by neutralizing hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions. Subsequent increases in pH may inhibit the action of pepsin. An increase in bicarbonate ions and prostaglandins may also confer cytoprotective effects. Calcium carbonate may also be used as a nutritional supplement or to treat hypocalcemia.

**Indication.** For relief of heartburn and acid indigestion. May also be used as a nutritional supplement or to treat hypocalcemia.

| popPK | Takada_2022 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study reports population PK parameters for roxadustat, with calcium carbonate serving only as a concomitant phosphate binder affecting bioavailability, not as the subject drug. |
| PD | Takada_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for roxadustat, including the effect of calcium carbonate (as a phosphate binder) on bioavailability, but it does not report any pharmacodynamic (PD) or exposure-response relationship for calcium carbonate itself. |
| popPK | Terry_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes a surgical technique using a calcium carbonate scaffold for cartilage repair and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters for calcium carbonate as a drug. |
| popPK | Tetens_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a clinical trial assessing bone health outcomes (BMD and bone turnover markers) rather than pharmacokinetic parameters, and calcium carbonate is used as a comparator supplement. |
| PGx | Valverde-Megías_2017 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the effect of a gene variant on the response to ranibizumab, not calcium_carbonate. |
| popPK | Vergin_1989 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the pharmacokinetics of pirenzepine, with calcium carbonate serving only as a component of the antacid comparator. |
| popPK | Wang_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a materials science study on drilling fluid filtration reducers using nano-calcium carbonate as a substrate, not a pharmacokinetic study of calcium carbonate as a drug. |
| PD | Wang_2020 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes the synthesis and rheological properties of a drilling fluid additive (graft copolymer on nano-calcium carbonate) and does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response relationship for calcium carbonate as a drug. |
| PD | Wang_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies the anti-VEGF agent conbercept, not calcium carbonate, and reports clinical response correlations rather than pharmacodynamic parameters. |
| popPK | Wang_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review on inorganic nanomaterials for colorectal cancer and does not study calcium carbonate pharmacokinetics. |
| PD | Wang_2025 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review on inorganic nanomaterials for colorectal cancer and does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response data for calcium carbonate. |
| popPK | Wu_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes calcium carbonate as a nanocarrier for a pesticide (berberine) in an agricultural context, not as a drug subject to pharmacokinetic analysis. |
| popPK | Xie_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies conbercept for diabetic macular edema and does not involve calcium_carbonate or pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| PGx | Yang_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies the biomineralization of calcium carbonate by bacteria, not the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of calcium carbonate as a drug in humans. |
| popPK | Zhu_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the pharmacokinetics of denosumab (and its biosimilar KN012), not calcium carbonate, which is only mentioned as a co-administered supplement. |
| PD | Zhu_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports population pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical efficacy (BMD changes) for denosumab, but does not model or report a pharmacodynamic (PD) or exposure-response relationship with numeric PD parameters. |
