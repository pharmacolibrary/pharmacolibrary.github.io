<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**Vmax, CL and V have no unit.**

Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. A reported unit could not be converted (Km), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — nedosiran: CL/F 6.1 L/h, V1/F 148 L, kabs 0.212 1/h, FR 0.692, V2/F 6.56e+03 L, Q/F 2.79 L/h, Vmax 3.37, Km 248 ng/mL, … (+2).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the links between molecules: this record has none, the second reading nedosiran → spot urine oxalate-to-creatinine ratio (none); it also differs on 2 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'units' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Ka2' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab2:row4:col2', 'Tab2:row4:col3', 'Tab2:row4:col4'])
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('ka.BW', value '-0.221') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('CL.BW', value '0.750') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q61 ('V.BW', value '1.00') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('Ka1.PH', value '1.32') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q66 ('Vmax.BW', value '0.492') — already have one for this compound
- routed 'ExpError' → Q315 (sigma) to residual_error — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- dropped PD-category row 'Kout' → Q328 (kout, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Zhang_2025_table_3:row0:col2', 'Zhang_2025_table_3:row0:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'BSL' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Zhang_2025_table_3:row1:col3', 'Zhang_2025_table_3:row1:col4'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Imax' → Q323 (Imax, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Zhang_2025_table_3:row2:col3', 'Zhang_2025_table_3:row2:col4'])
- dropped PD-category row 'IC50' → Q322 (IC50, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Zhang_2025_table_3:row3:col3', 'Zhang_2025_table_3:row3:col4'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Gamma' → Q325 (Hill, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Zhang_2025_table_3:row4:col3'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Lambda' → Q342 (lambda_hazard, category G14) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Zhang_2025_table_3:row5:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'AGE.BSL' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Zhang_2025_table_3:row6:col3', 'Zhang_2025_table_3:row6:col4'])
- routed 'PropError' → Q316 (prop_error) to residual_error — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number 70 (source ['Tab2:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number 90 (source ['Tab2:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['Tab2:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- implicit units: 'CL/F' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'CL/F is apparent clearance. In population PK, clearance is conventionally expressed in L/h. The value 6.10 is consistent')
- implicit units: 'Vc/F' → L (from the popPK convention: 'Vc/F is the apparent volume of distribution of the central compartment. Volumes are conventionally expressed in L. The v')
- implicit units: 'Ka1' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'Ka1 is an absorption rate constant (first-order). Rate constants are conventionally expressed in 1/h. The value 0.212 is')
- implicit units: 'Vp/F' → L (from the popPK convention: 'Vp/F is the apparent volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment. Volumes are conventionally expressed in L. Th')
- implicit units: 'Q/F' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'Q/F is the apparent intercompartmental clearance. Intercompartmental clearances are conventionally expressed in L/h. The')
- implicit units: 'Vmax' — the LLM proposed 'ng/mL/h', whose dimension does not fit Q66; left unset
- implicit units: 'KM' → ng/mL (from the popPK convention: 'KM is the Michaelis constant (substrate concentration at half Vmax). It has the same units as the drug concentration. Gi')
- implicit units: 'CL.EGFR' — the LLM proposed '1', whose dimension does not fit Q22; left unset
- implicit units: 'Vc.EGFR' — the LLM proposed '1', whose dimension does not fit Q61; left unset
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=nedosiran
- structure disagreement: deterministic 3C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- molar mass: none found for 'nedosiran' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
