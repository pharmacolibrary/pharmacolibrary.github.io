A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The glyceryl trinitrate record was rejected because apparent parameters (CL/F 16 ml/min/kg, V/F 6.5 L) were combined with an explicit bioavailability Fab of 0.015, double-correcting for F; Fab's unit is also given as mg/kg instead of a fraction.**

The record, built from the abstract of Lee_1990 alone so summary statistics stood in for a fitted model, reports CL/F and V/F as bioavailability-adjusted apparent parameters while also carrying Fab = 0.015, which the coherence check flagged as a double correction for F. The bioavailability value 0.015 is labelled with unit mg/kg although it is defined as the fraction of drug reaching systemic circulation. A second reader disputed the parameterization (apparent vs mechanistic) and left the values 0.015, 16, 45 min, 0.02 h−1 and 6.5 L unmatched. Extracted — glyceryl trinitrate: Fab 0.015 mg/kg, t1/2z 45 min, CL/F 16 ml/min/kg, V/F 6.5 L, kabs 0.02 h−1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on how the model is parameterised: this record has apparent, the second reading mechanistic; it also differs on 6 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

**Parameters:** 5 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped value-less row: 'apparent fractional GTN clearances to 1,2-GDN (CLapp,m1)' (captured trailing unit 'CLapp,m1' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'apparent fractional GTN clearances to 1,3-GDN (CLapp,m2)' (captured trailing unit 'CLapp,m2' for child rows)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'GTN doses' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Lee_1990:abstract'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'high i.v.' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Lee_1990:abstract'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=glyceryl_trinitrate
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: 2 first-order transfer(s) across 3 compounds → general_linear
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- gap-filled Q76 (V/F) from Kielbasa_2019's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Kielbasa_2019's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Lee_1990_metadata.yaml (7 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
