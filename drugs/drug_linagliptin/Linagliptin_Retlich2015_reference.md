A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**Kabs, t1/2ka , k13, Q/F, V, Cmax and KD have no unit.**

Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. A reported unit could not be converted (Bmax), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — linagliptin: kabs 0.933, t1/2ka 0.795, k13 0.441, V1/F 715 L, Q/F 412, V 1.65e+03, CL/F 258 L/h, Bmax 4.97 nmol/L, … (+2).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has linagliptin, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 12 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `needs_review` (reviewed 2026-09-28 14:38:29.277287+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-05 00:17:05.752499+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

**Model structure:** 2-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 11 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, Q/F, V1/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section residual_error: 'σ prop,phase 2a (%)h' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability')
- table section residual_error: 'σ prop,phase 2b (%)h' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability')
- column 'description' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'F in study 4 (%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab4:row3:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Weight_F b' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab4:row4:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Dose_K a c' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab4:row8:col1', 'Tab4:row8:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'GGT_CLe,f' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab4:row13:col1'])
- dropped duplicate Q32 ('Dose_B max,C g', value '3.41') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Age_B max,C g' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab4:row17:col1'])
- dropped duplicate Q32 ('Sex_B max,C e', value '0.457') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'A max,P/F (nmol)d' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab4:row20:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'πF (CV %)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab4:row28:col1'])
- implicit units: 'K a,1 (1/h)' → 1/h (from the paper text: "Table 4 lists the parameter as 'K a,1 (1/h)' with value 0.933.")
- implicit units: 'K a,2 (1/h)' — the LLM proposed '1/h', whose dimension does not fit Q95; left unset
- implicit units: 'K a,3 (1/h)' → 1/h (from the paper text: "Table 4 lists the parameter as 'K a,3 (1/h)' with value 0.441.")
- implicit units: 'Q P/F (L/h)d' → L/h (from the paper text: "Table 4 lists the parameter as 'Q P/F (L/h)d' with value 412.")
- implicit units: 'V P/F (L)d' → L (from the paper text: "Table 4 lists the parameter as 'V P/F (L)d' with value 1,650.")
- implicit units: 'DPP_B max,C g' — the LLM proposed 'nmol/L', whose dimension does not fit Q32; left unset
- implicit units: 'K d (nmol/L)d' — the LLM proposed 'nmol/L', whose dimension does not fit Q331; left unset
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=linagliptin
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell Tab4:row3:col2 = 'Typical relative bioavailability in study 4'
- unparsed cell Tab4:row5:col2 = 'Typical absorption rate constant study 1 (powder in bottle formulation)'
- unparsed cell Tab4:row6:col2 = 'Typical absorption rate constant study 2 (tablet formulation 1)'
- unparsed cell Tab4:row15:col2 = 'Percentage change in B max,C per RFU change from the median DPP-4 activity of the population'
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 4
