**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The linagliptin record was rejected because the paper reports no distribution volume and no clearance or elimination, so it is not a compartmental population PK model, and a structural parameter failed a dimensional check.**

The record for linagliptin in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus contains only exposure and summary parameters — AUC of 150 nmol·h/L, protein binding of 99%, oral bioavailability of 30%, terminal half-life of 100 hours, 5% excreted unchanged, and an absorption rate constant of 1.63 h−1 — but no volume of distribution and no clearance or elimination rate, so it is an exposure/outcome paper rather than a compartmental population PK model. A dimensional check on a structural parameter failed with a dimension mismatch. The record was also built from the paper's abstract alone, so reported summary statistics stood in for a fitted model. Extracted — linagliptin: AUC 150 nmol · h/L, fu 99 %, Fab 30 %, t1/2z 100 hours, fe 5 %, kabs 1.63 h -1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of auc: this record has 150, the second reading none; it also differs on 6 more fields. That field does not shape the model.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped value-less row: 'C(max)' (captured trailing unit 'max' for child rows)
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'AUC' → Q88 (unit '[substance] * [time] / [length] ** 3' vs ontology '[mass] * [time] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('accumulation half-life', value 10) — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=linagliptin
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Tadayasu_2013's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Graefe-Mody_2012_metadata.yaml (8 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
