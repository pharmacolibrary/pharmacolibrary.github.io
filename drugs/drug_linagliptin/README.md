## About

**Description.** Linagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for the treatment of type II diabetes [L9557]. Linagliptin differs from other DPP-4 inhibitors in that it has a non-linear pharmacokinetic profile, is not primarily eliminated by the renal system, and obeys concentration dependant protein binding[A37050]. Linagliptin was approved by the FDA on May 2, 2011[L9557].

**Indication.** Linagliptin is indicated for the treatment of type II diabetes in addition to diet and exercise[L9557]. It should not be used to treat type I diabetes or in diabetic ketoacidosis.[L9557] An extended-release combination product containing empagliflozin, linagliptin, and metformin was approved by the FDA in January 2020 for the improvement of glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when used adjunctively with diet and exercise.[L11479]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
