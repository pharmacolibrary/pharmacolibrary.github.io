A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of min: this record has 36.5, the second reading none; it also differs on 1 more field. That field does not shape the model.

> ℹ️ No reviewer record yet — status shown is the scholar **validate** result; simulation-based reviewer checks have not been run.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="dapsone" model-id="Dapsone_Kotila2023_base_model_selection" status="needs_review" stale="false" population="healthy Nigerians" measured-compound="dapsone" parameterization="apparent" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 4 extracted, plus 1 covariate effect.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'IIV Tlag' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-individual variability (IIV, %)')
- table section iiv: 'IIV ka' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-individual variability (IIV, %)')
- table section iiv: 'IIV V/F' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-individual variability (IIV, %)')
- table section iiv: 'IIV Cl/F' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter-individual variability (IIV, %)')
- table section residual_error: 'Proportional error' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual error model')
- column 'base model selection' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)

- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=dapsone
- population split: 'base model selection' subgroup of Kotila_2023 (paper reports 3 populations: base model selection, mean, median)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell T2:row4:col1 = '1 compartment, with lag time'
- unparsed cell T2:row5:col1 = '1 compartment with transit compartment'
- unparsed cell T2:row6:col1 = '2 compartment, no lag time'
- unparsed cell T2:row26:col1 = 'ka (h−1)'
- transposed table Kotila_2023_table_1: parameters were across the columns, populations/subgroups down the first column — transposed for parsing
- companion parameter table 1 transcribed (64 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 1
