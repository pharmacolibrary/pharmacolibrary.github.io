A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The prednisolone record was rejected because a structural parameter had a dimension mismatch and a clearance/volume value fell outside the physiological window, consistent with a unit/scale extraction error.**

The clearance/volume check flagged an implausible magnitude attributed to a unit or scale extraction error, and a structural parameter failed the dimension check. A reported unit could not be converted to SI, so the parameter arrived without an SI value. The second reader could not confirm the oral absorption lag time (0.36 h) or the volume V Glu1 (0.3 L), recording no value for either. Extracted — prednisolone: ktr 12.5 h-1, MTT 0.63 h, Vnorm 101 L/70 kg, CLu 27.6 L/h/70 kg, Bmax 6.77, KD 0.0095 nmol, V 0.3 L, tlag 0.36 hour.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of t lag,oral: this record has 0.36, the second reading none; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'K1 (nmol)' → Q331 (unit '[substance]' vs ontology '[mass] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Kns' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['de_2023_table_p5_1:row7:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'βciclosporine/CLU' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['de_2023_table_p5_1:row8:col1', 'de_2023_table_p5_1:row8:col2'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=prednisolone
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- gap-filled Q61 (V) from Tan_2024's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q83 (tlag) from Tan_2024's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- no LLM table selection; kept 2 deterministically-scored parameter table(s)
