The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="primaquine" model-id="Primaquine_Lee2021_reference" status="rejected" stale="false" population="healthy Korean adults (normal and obese groups)" measured-compound="primaquine" parameterization="apparent" topology="parent_metabolite"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** parent + metabolite; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 0 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CLm/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

_No resolved parameters._

### Unresolved rows _(no Q-code or no value — not parameters)_
| label (paper) | Q-code | value | link |
|---|---|---|---|
| CLMAO | Q351 | not captured | llm |
| CLCYP | Q370 | not captured | llm |
| CLM | Q22 | not captured | exact |

- dropped value-less row: 'V3'

- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'CLMAO' → Q351 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review

- dropped value-less row: 'KA'
- dropped value-less row: 'ALAG1'
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'COVAS' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['pharmaceutics-13-00652-t002:row9:col2', 'pharmaceutics-13-00652-t002:row9:col3'])

- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=primaquine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- template fit: none — pbpk model — not a compartmental parent–metabolite model (site hepatic: 'A minimal physiology-based pharmacokinetic model connected with a liver compartment comprehensively described the data, ')
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles (LLM): model_class=pbpk; 18/18 row label(s) assigned, 10 linked by role; re-tagged parent→carboxyprimaquine ×3
- review gap-fill skipped: this record carries no value of its own, and a model assembled entirely from other papers is not this paper's model
