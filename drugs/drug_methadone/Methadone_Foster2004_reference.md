**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**Methadone's Vd, ka and Tlag were not reported, so library defaults were substituted and the model was quarantined; k12 (0.16 h-1) was also not covered.**

The record reports only CL/F (0.19 l h-1) and k12 (0.16 h-1) for methadone; volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time had no source value, so placeholders stood in and the model was held back rather than published with invented numbers. The k12 parameter was neither emitted nor defaulted, so parameter coverage covered 1 of 2 expected parameters. The builder also assumed F=1 and Fm=1 with no molar correction (apparent parameterization) and defaulted ka, which was judged an invented absorption deviation. The covariate effects defined in the record were not simulated — only the reference individual was. A second reader additionally disagreed on the analyte, reading rac-methadone rather than methadone, and proposed R/S-enantiomer interconversion links absent from the record. Extracted — methadone: CL/F 0.19 l h -1, k12 0.16 h -1, AUC 0.026, Ct 0.24.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has methadone, the second reading rac-methadone; it also differs on 2 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.
