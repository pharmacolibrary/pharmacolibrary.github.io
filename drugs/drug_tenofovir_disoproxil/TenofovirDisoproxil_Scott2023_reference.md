A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**Tenofovir's apparent clearance (16.7 L/h) is physiologically implausible for pregnant adults, indicating an extraction error.**

The apparent clearance of tenofovir is listed as 16.7 L/h, which falls outside the physiological window for the population. This magnitude mismatch is inconsistent with the peripheral volume of distribution recorded as 190 L/h. The findings confirm that the clearance value was extracted with an incorrect scale or unit conversion. Extracted — tenofovir disoproxil: CLm/F 16.7 L/h, V1/F 58.8 L, Q/F 13.8 L/h, V2/F 190 L/h, kabs 0.616 /h.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-10-07 14:43:02.330514+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 16:32:17.767507+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine`, measured `tenofovir (TFV)`.

**Model structure:** general linear; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 5 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CLm/F, Q/F, V1/F, V2/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'V3/F (L/h)' → Q82 (unit '[length] ** 3 / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped value-less row: 'CL/F increment during 1st trimester (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'CL/F increment during 2nd trimester (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'CL/F increment during 3rd trimester (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'CL/F increment during pregnancy (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- metabolite tenofovir (tfv): Q27→Q351 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=tenofovir (TFV)
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles: 3 per-group rows of tenofovir (TFV) covariate_effect but 0 reference group(s) — kept as printed
- row roles: 3 per-group rows of tenofovir (TFV) residual_error but 0 reference group(s) — kept as printed
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 17/17 row label(s) assigned, 20 linked by role; re-tagged parent→tenofovir (TFV) ×40, parent→emtricitabine (FTC) ×1
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
