<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**Tenofovir diphosphate is an orphan metabolite, and the intercompartmental clearance parameter uses a rate constant unit.**

The record defines tenofovir diphosphate as a metabolite, but the link from the parent tenofovir has an unknown relation type, making it an unreachable compartment. Additionally, the intercompartmental clearance parameter (Q) has a dimension mismatch, where a rate constant unit was applied to a clearance parameter. A unit for a reported parameter could not be converted to SI units. Extracted — tenofovir disoproxil: kabs 9.81 h−1, V1/F 404 L, Q 0.604 h−1, kel 0.13 h−1, tlag 0.5 h; tenofovir_diphosphate: kfm 0.017 h−1, kel 0.013 h−1.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-10-07 14:42:56.802805+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 16:32:05.847711+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `tenofovir disoproxil fumarate`, measured `tenofovir`.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="tenofovir disoproxil" model-id="TenofovirDisoproxil_Burns2015_base" status="rejected" stale="true" population="healthy women" measured-compound="tenofovir" parameterization="apparent" topology="parent_metabolite"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** parent + metabolite; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 7 extracted.

**Parameterization:** V1/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q900 ('Obj Func', value '2586') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Condition #' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['jcph461-tbl-0001:row3:col1'])
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'K23 (h−1)' → Q30 (unit '1 / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'K32 (h−1)' → Q30 (unit '1 / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q30 ('K32 (h−1)', value '0.37') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Proportional, TFV (%CV)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['jcph461-tbl-0001:row18:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Proportional, TFV‐DP (PBMC) (%CV)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['jcph461-tbl-0001:row19:col1'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=tenofovir
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- model-stage split: 'base model' is the base model of Burns_2015 (paper reports 2 stages: base model, final model); same population, different model-building step
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 18/18 row label(s) assigned, 16 linked by role; re-tagged parent→tenofovir ×21, parent→tenofovir-diphosphate ×8
- skipped review gap-fill of CL: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
