<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The record was rejected because V(max) is 1376 mg/day, a mass rate incompatible with volume of distribution.**

The V(max) parameter carries a value of 1376 mg/day, but its label and meaning describe it as a volume of distribution. This creates a fundamental dimensional error in the model structure. Additionally, the record relies solely on abstract summary statistics rather than a fitted model. Extracted — delavirdine: Vss 67.6 L, CL/F 19.8 L/h, Km 6.3 micromol/L, CL/F 0.57 L/h, V/F 24.7 L, V 1.38e+03 mg/day.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-10-07 14:20:06.926377+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 15:56:22.378457+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

**Model structure:** nonlinear / manual; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 5 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'concentration at half the maximum velocity of metabolism (V(max))' → Q1 (unit '[substance] / [length] ** 3' vs ontology '[mass] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('first order oral clearance', value 0.57) — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('apparent clearance', value 29.7) — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'V(max)' → Q61 (unit '[mass] / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=delavirdine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: prose indicates saturable/MM/TMDD/time-varying kinetics — manual_model_class
- template fit: none — nonlinear / manual model class
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 7/7 row label(s) assigned, 5 linked by role; re-tagged delavirdine→parent ×7
- molar mass: no plausible PubChem entry for 'N-delavirdine' ('N-desalkyl delavirdine') — left in mass units
- molar mass: none found for 'N-delavirdine' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is MANUAL_MODEL_CLASS (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is MANUAL_MODEL_CLASS (peripheral family needs ≥2C)

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Smith_2005_metadata.yaml (7 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
