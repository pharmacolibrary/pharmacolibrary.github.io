<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The model does not reproduce the paper's terminal half-life (paper 5, model 0.958).**

Simulated as the paper dosed it, the model's terminal half-life differs from the value the paper reports by more than the tolerance. Extracted — sodium salicylate: V 5.01 liter, t1/2β 316 min, CL 0.04 L/h/kg, kabs 0.64 1/h, tlag 0.42 h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has sodium salicylate, the second reading sodium_salicylate; it also differs on 4 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `needs_review` (reviewed 2026-09-28 14:40:31.539889+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 06:13:56.554236+00:00). Current validate status: `needs_review`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `sodium salicylate`, measured `salicylic acid`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q61 ('Vₐ (area), liter', value '9.26') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=salicylic acid
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- population split: 'six anephric patients' subgroup of Lowenthal_1974 (paper reports 3 populations: four normal subjects*, patients, six anephric patients)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q83 (tlag) from Somani_2016's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2, 3
- unparsed cell Lowenthal_1974_table_3:row5:col3 = '&gt; 0.7'
- unparsed cell Lowenthal_1974_table_3:row6:col3 = '&gt; 0.8'
- unparsed cell Lowenthal_1974_table_3:row7:col3 = '&gt; 0.1'
