<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Salicylate drives name (in mg/dl): disease-progression model.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> In GK rats fed salsalate, blood salicylate acts on weekly measured blood glucose (mg/dl) via an indirect response model within a disease progression framework, where glucose is produced at zero-order kin_glu (223 mg/dl/week) and eliminated by first-order utilization kout_glu (1.34 1/week); the drug effect is inhibitory (record: inhibition), consistent with inhibition of glucose production/utilization balance, while disease components (insulin resistance Sin, beta-cell function BFm) jointly reduce glucose utilization. The excerpts do not state the exact drug mechanism link (e.g., which parameter salicylate inhibits) and give no Imax, IC50, EC50, Emax, ke0, or gamma values.
