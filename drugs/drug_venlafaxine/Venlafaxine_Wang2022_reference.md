A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**Every check that could be run on this record passed.**

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the links between molecules: this record has none, the second reading venlafaxine → o-desmethyl venlafaxine (metabolism); it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'FP' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T2:row6:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θmorbid state on CL/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T2:row7:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θamisulpride on CL/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T2:row8:col1'])
- dropped duplicate Q351 ('θamisulpride on CLM/F', value '0.593') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('CL/F', value '0.219') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q76 ('V/F', value '0.106') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q351 ('CLM/F', value '0.156') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q367 ('V M/F', value '1.38') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=venlafaxine
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
