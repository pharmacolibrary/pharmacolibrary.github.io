## About

Minoxidil is a vasodilator used to treat high blood pressure, including severe hypertension, and applied to the skin to treat hair loss (alopecia). It remains in use: as an oral antihypertensive and as a topical dermatological preparation, and is approved though it carries a boxed warning.
