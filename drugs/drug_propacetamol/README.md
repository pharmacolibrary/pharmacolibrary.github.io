<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PD | Anderson_2005 | not_relevant | 3 | 2 | The paper is a population PK analysis that mentions a specific concentration (10 mg/L) associated with a pain score (2.6/10) in the conclusion, but it does not report a fitted PD model, Emax/EC50 parameters, or a derived concentration-effect curve. |
| PGx | Anderson_2006 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The text is a general review of paediatric analgesics that mentions pharmacogenomics and propacetamol only in passing, without reporting specific gene-variant effects on PK or PD parameters. |
| popPK | Barsch_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro electrophysiology investigation of propacetamol's metabolite on glycine transporters and receptors, reporting no pharmacokinetic disposition parameters. |
| PD | Barsch_2021 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the molecular mechanism of propacetamol's metabolite (DEG) on glycine transporters and receptors in Xenopus oocytes, not the pharmacodynamic exposure-response relationship of propacetamol itself in a clinical or physiological context. |
| PGx | Cai_2025 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the pharmacogenomics of valproic acid, not propacetamol. |
| popPK | Hahn_2003 | relevant | 8 | 2 | The study fits a pharmacokinetic model for paracetamol (the active metabolite of propacetamol) and reports initial concentrations, but specific quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, ka) are not explicitly listed in the provided text. |
| popPK | Palmer_2008 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study reports pharmacokinetic parameters for acetaminophen (the active metabolite), not propacetamol, despite mentioning propacetamol in the background and conclusions. |
| PGx | Tsai_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the protective effects of kaempferol on propacetamol-induced liver injury in mice, focusing on mechanisms like CYP2E1 and UGT1A1 modulation, but does not report pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants) on PK or PD parameters. |
