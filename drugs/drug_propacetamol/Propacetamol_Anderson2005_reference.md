A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The propacetamol/paracetamol record was rejected because apparent parameters (V2/F 24 l, CL/F 16 l/h, Q2/F 55 l/h) were additionally corrected by Frel 0.5, a structural parameter had a dimension mismatch, and a compartment was unreachable.**

The record mixes apparent (F-adjusted) parameters — V2/F 24 l x 70 kg(-1), V3/F 30 l x 70 kg(-1), CL/F 16 l x h(-1) x 70 kg(-1), Q2/F 55 l x h(-1) x 70 kg(-1) — with a relative bioavailability Frel of 0.5, so bioavailability would be applied twice (double correction). A dimension mismatch was flagged on a structural parameter, and a compartment or metabolite had no path from the dose. The record was built from the abstract alone, so reported summary statistics stood in for a fitted model, and a second reader disagreed on the parameterization (mechanistic rather than apparent), on the presence of a propacetamol-to-paracetamol hydrolysis link, and on the bioavailability value 0.5. Extracted — paracetamol: V2/F 24 l x 70 kg(-1), V3/F 30 l x 70 kg(-1), CL/F 16 l x h(-1) x 70 kg(-1), Q2/F 55 l x h(-1) x 70 kg(-1), CL 1.87 l x h(-1) 70 kg(-1), V2 45 l x 70 kg(-1), Frel 0.5 F.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the links between molecules: this record has none, the second reading propacetamol → paracetamol (hydrolysis); it also differs on 9 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'central volume (V2/F(oral))' → Q82 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'peripheral volume of distribution (V3/F(oral))' → Q78 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'l x h(-1) x 70 kg(-1)' (CL/F)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'l x h(-1) x 70 kg(-1)' (Q2/F)
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Clearance' → Q22 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2 / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Peripheral volume of distribution' → Q64 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'target concentration' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Anderson_2005:abstract'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=paracetamol
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures 'paracetamol', not propacetamol — the review values are the parent's

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Anderson_2005_metadata.yaml (12 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
