A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for magnesium sulfate's clearance and volume of distribution.**

The model was built, but magnesium sulfate's clearance and volume of distribution had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. Extracted — magnesium sulfate: V 25.1 L, CL 2.98 L/h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has magnesium_sulfate, the second reading magnesium sulfate; it also differs on 3 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.
