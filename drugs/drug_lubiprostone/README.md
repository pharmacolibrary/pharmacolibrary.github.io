## About

**Description.** Lubiprostone is a medication used in the management of idiopathic chronic constipation. A prostaglandin E1 derivative, lubiprostone is a bicyclic fatty acid that activates ClC-2 chloride channels located on the apical side of the gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Activation of these channels promotes the secretion of a chloride-rich fluid that soften the stool, increase gastrointestinal motility, and induce spontaneous bowel movements (SBM).

**Indication.** Lubiprostone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic idiopathic constipation, or opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.[L4421] It is also indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in female patients ≥18 years old.[L4421]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
