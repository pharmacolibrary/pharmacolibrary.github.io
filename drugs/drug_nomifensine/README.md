## About

**Description.** Nomifensine, formerly marketed as Merital capsules, was associated with an increased incidence of hemolytic anemia. The approved application holder removed Merital capsules from the market on January 23, 1986. FDA published a notice of its determination that Merital capsules were removed from the market for safety reasons (see the Federal Register of June 17, 1986 (51 FR 21981)). Approval of the NDA for Merital capsules was withdrawn on March 20, 1992 (see the Federal Register of March 20, 1992 (57 FR 9729)). Also withdrawn from the Canadian and UK markets.

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| PD | Sharif_1989 | not_relevant | 3 | 4 | The paper reports in vitro binding affinity (Ki) and uptake inhibition (IC50) constants for nomifensine, which are pharmacological potency parameters, but it does not report an in vivo exposure-response or dose-response relationship (e.g., Emax, EC50, or effect vs. plasma concentration) for the drug. |
| popPK | Sistovaris_1983 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The paper describes a TLC assay method and mentions PK models were used, but no quantitative PK parameter values (CL, V, t1/2, etc.) for nomifensine are present in the evidence. |
| popPK | Stauderman_1985 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic investigation of serotonin uptake in rat spinal cord synaptosomes, not a pharmacokinetic study, and nomifensine is used only as a comparator inhibitor. |

| PD | Strait_1986 | not_relevant | 1 | 1 | The paper reports IC50 values for dopamine and apomorphine in blocking tyrosine hydroxylase activation, but nomifensine is only used as a tool compound (MAO inhibitor) to prevent dopamine metabolism, not as the subject of a dose-response or exposure-response analysis. |
| popPK | Suarez-Roca_1987 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a neuropharmacological investigation of dopamine-cholinergic mechanisms in brain slices, and nomifensine is used only as a tool compound to block uptake, with no pharmacokinetic parameters reported. |
| PD | Suarez-Roca_1987 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The paper mentions nomifensine only qualitatively as a tool to increase synaptic dopamine, without providing any specific concentration-effect data, dose-response curves, or numeric PD parameters for nomifensine itself. |
| popPK | Szász_2005 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic investigation of monoamine release where nomifensine is used only as a tool compound (uptake inhibitor), not as the subject of pharmacokinetic analysis. |
| PD | Szász_2005 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports dose-response data for DMPP (the agonist), not nomifensine; nomifensine is used only as a qualitative inhibitor to distinguish release mechanisms. |
| popPK | Taeuber_1979 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a pharmacodynamic comparison of acute effects and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters for nomifensine. |
| PD | Taeuber_1979 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The study reports qualitative behavioral and physiological effects of fixed doses but does not provide plasma concentration data or numeric PD parameters (e.g., EC50, Emax) to establish an exposure-response relationship. |
| popPK | Tedroff_1990 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study is a PET imaging analysis of brain kinetics in a small patient cohort, not a systemic population pharmacokinetic study, and no quantitative PK parameter values (CL, V, etc.) are provided in the evidence. |
| popPK | Tong_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a drug repositioning study focusing on molecular docking and cell viability (IC50) for NUDT5 inhibition, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting disposition parameters for nomifensine. |
