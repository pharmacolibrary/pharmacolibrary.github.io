<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
</details>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**Only clearance was extracted — no volume; q and CL have no unit.**

A model needs both clearance and volume; without the volume it could only be built on a library default, so it was not. Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. A reported unit could not be converted (CL), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — palivizumab: Q 2.3, Fab 3.13, CL 9.95 mo, kabs 0.373 day Ϫ1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of q_wt_70_0.75: this record has 8.37, the second reading none; it also differs on 5 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

**Model structure:** 1-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 4 extracted, plus 2 covariate effects.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'iiv' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'RACE ϭ black' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_2:row3:col1', 'tab_2:row3:col2'])
- dropped value-less row: 'RACE ϭ Hispanic 1.05'
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'RACE ϭ Asian' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_2:row5:col1', 'tab_2:row5:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'RACE ϭ other' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_2:row6:col1', 'tab_2:row6:col2'])
- dropped value-less row: 'titer ϭ 10'
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'titer ϭ 20' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_2:row9:col1', 'tab_2:row9:col2'])
- dropped value-less row: 'titer ϭ 40'
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'titer Ն 80' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_2:row11:col1', 'tab_2:row11:col2'])
- dropped value-less row: 'V c ϫ (WT/70) 1.0 , ml 4,090'
- dropped value-less row: 'RACE ϭ Hispanic 1.06'
- dropped value-less row: 'V p ϫ (WT/70) 1.0 , ml 2,230'
- covariate level 'Q ϫ (WT/70) 0.75 ,' → Q900:q_wt_70_0.75 = 8.37 (power on Q30)
- dropped value-less row: 'k a , day Ϫ1'
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): '␤' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_2:row19:col1', 'tab_2:row19:col2'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'mo' (CL)
- routed '2 prop' → Q316 (prop_error) to residual_error — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- covariate effect for Q354 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=palivizumab
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- skipped review gap-fill of V from Madhi_2025: its label names a different analyte ('clesrovimab') — 'volume of distribution of clesrovimab'
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Robbie_2012's review values (primary lacked it)
