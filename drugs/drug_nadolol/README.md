## About

**Description.** Nadolol is a nonselective beta adrenal receptor blocker that is used to lower blood pressure.[L7922,L7925] Nonselective beta adrenal receptor blockers may no longer be first line in the treatment of hypertension as newer generations of beta adrenal receptor blockers have higher selectivity and offer better rates of adverse effects.[A34177]

Nadolol was granted FDA approval on 10 December 1979.[L7922]

**Indication.** Nadolol is indicated to treat angina pectoris and hypertension.[L7922] Another product formulated with [bendroflumethiazide] is indicated to treat hypertension.[L7925]

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
