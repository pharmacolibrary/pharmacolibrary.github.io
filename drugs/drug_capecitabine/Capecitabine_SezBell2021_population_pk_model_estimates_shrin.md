<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
</details>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The clearance plausibility check could not be computed.**

The check had no reference to compare the clearance against, so the value is unverified rather than shown to be wrong. Extracted — capecitabine: tlag 0.28 h, kabs 2.07 h -1, CL 294 L/h, Q 67 %, V2 55 %.

**Model structure:** general linear; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 5 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped value-less row: 't₁ag (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'kₐ (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'CL₀ (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'CL₂ (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'CL₃ (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'CL₄ (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'V₂ (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'CorrCL₂ − CL₀ (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'Corrkₐ − CL₀ (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'Corrkₐ − CL₂ (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'CAP (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: "5'-DFUR (%)" (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: '5-FU (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- salvaged Q83 ('t lag (h)'=0.28) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q49 ('k a (h -1 )'=2.07) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q22 ('CL 0 CAP (L/h)'=294) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q30 ('CL 2 (%)'=67) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q64 ('V 2 (%)'=55) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q22 (CL 0 CAP (L/h)); Q30 (CL 2 (%)); Q64 (V 2 (%))
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=capecitabine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: 2 first-order transfer(s) across 3 compounds → general_linear
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'population pk model estimates shrinkage (%)' subgroup of Sáez-Belló_2021 (paper reports 3 populations: population pk model estimates rse (%), population pk model estimates shrinkage (%), population pk model estimates value)

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- unparsed cell Sáez-Belló_2021_table_p5_1:row21:col6 = '−88 to −71'
- unparsed cell Sáez-Belló_2021_table_p5_1:row22:col6 = '−101 to −87'
