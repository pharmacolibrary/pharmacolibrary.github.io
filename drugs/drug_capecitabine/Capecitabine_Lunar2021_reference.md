**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The capecitabine model was quarantined because its elimination clearance had no extracted value and a placeholder was used, and the V/F parameter (11.8 L) was neither emitted nor defaulted.**

No value for capecitabine's elimination clearance was available, so a library placeholder stood in for it and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. The parameter coverage check expected 5 parameters emitted or defaulted but found only 4, with V/F (11.8 L) missing from both. The builder also assumed apparent parameterization (F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction). A second reader disagreed on several parameter assignments, including the terminal half-life identifier, and left the AUC ratio (24), F (14.4), and k23/k34 values (11.6, 12.4 /h) unmatched. Extracted — capecitabine: kabs 13.6 /h, tlag 10.9 h, Frel 14.4, V/F 11.8 L, kel 12.2 /h, k13 11.6 /h, k31 12.4 /h, k12 14.9 /h, … (+2).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[beta_k 23 _t cda].parameter_id`: this record has Q60, the second reading Q68; it also differs on 4 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

**Model structure:** 1-compartment general linear model (non-mammillary edges) — template `PK_General_Linear`.  
**Parameters:** 10 extracted.

**Parameterization:** V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `model_quarantined`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: '/h' (kabs)
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('ka 2 (/h)', value '12.4') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q83 ('t lag2 (h)', value '13.6') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: '/h' (kel)
- unit_dimension_unknown: '/h' (k13)
- unit_dimension_unknown: '/h' (k31)
- dropped duplicate Q47 ('k 40 (/h)', value '16') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: '/h' (k12)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'beta_k 40 _t Age' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row16:col2', 'tab_0:row16:col3', 'tab_0:row16:col4'])
- dropped duplicate Q60 ('beta_k 34 _t ALP', value '27.3') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=capecitabine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: 3 first-order transfer(s) across 4 compounds → general_linear
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- unit re-normalised: kabs '/h' now converts (value unchanged)
- unit re-normalised: kel '/h' now converts (value unchanged)
- unit re-normalised: k13 '/h' now converts (value unchanged)
- unit re-normalised: k31 '/h' now converts (value unchanged)
- unit re-normalised: k12 '/h' now converts (value unchanged)
- skipped review gap-fill of CL: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
