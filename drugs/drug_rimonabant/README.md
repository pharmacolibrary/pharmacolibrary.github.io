## About

**Description.** Rimonabant is an anorectic anti-obesity drug produced and marketed by Sanofi-Aventis. It is an inverse agonist for the cannabinoid receptor CB1. Its main avenue of effect is reduction in appetite. Rimonabant is the first selective CB1 receptor blocker to be approved for use anywhere in the world. Rimonabant is approved in 38 countries including the E.U., Mexico, and Brazil. It was rejected for approval for use in the United States. This decision was made after a U.S. advisory panel recommended the medicine not be approved because it may increase suicidal thinking and depression.

**Indication.** For use in conjunction with diet and exercise for patients with a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, or patients wih a BMI greater than 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with associated risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia.

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

| popPK | Sutherland_2023 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a preclinical safety pharmacology study focusing on in-vitro assay data and adverse drug reaction associations, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting disposition parameters for rimonabant. |
| PD | Sutherland_2023 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a database resource for in vitro secondary pharmacology (AC50 values) and safety margins, not a pharmacodynamic study reporting exposure-response or dose-response relationships for rimonabant. |
| popPK | Terry_2010 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the PET radioligand 18F-FMPEP-d, using rimonabant only as a receptor blocker for non-specific binding determination, and does not report pharmacokinetic parameters for rimonabant. |
| PGx | Viveros_2008 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a general review of the endocannabinoid system and mentions rimonabant only as an example of a CB1 inverse agonist, without reporting any pharmacogenomic data or specific PK/PD parameter changes linked to genetic variants. |
| popPK | Vlot_2017 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The paper is a mechanistic PBPK-QSAR modeling study using rimonabant as a simulation example, not a study reporting original quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, etc.) for the drug. |
| popPK | Yang_2015 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacological effects of a novel NAAA inhibitor (F96), using rimonabant only as a CB1 antagonist comparator to rule out cannabinoid receptor involvement, and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters for rimonabant. |
| PD | Yang_2015 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies the NAAA inhibitor F96, not rimonabant; rimonabant is only used as a negative control antagonist. |
| popPK | Yoon_2023 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a mechanistic in-vitro study on rimonabant analogues and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| popPK | Yoon_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro mechanistic study on anti-inflammatory activity and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters for rimonabant. |
| popPK | Yun_2016 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the cardiotoxicity and hERG channel inhibition of the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-030, using rimonabant only as a mechanistic comparator (CB1 antagonist) without reporting any pharmacokinetic parameters for it. |
| PD | Yun_2016 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the pharmacodynamics of JWH-030 (reporting its IC50), while rimonabant is only mentioned as a negative control antagonist that did not inhibit cytotoxicity, with no PD parameters reported for rimonabant. |
| popPK | Zhu_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on CB1 receptor signalling bias and kinetic modelling of receptor internalisation, not the pharmacokinetic disposition parameters (CL, V, etc.) of rimonabant. |
| PD | Zhu_2020 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on CB1 receptor signalling bias using a specific set of ligands (CP55,940, WIN55,212-2, etc.) and does not mention or analyze rimonabant. |
| popPK | unknown_2011 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The evidence consists only of a conference title and dates, containing no pharmacokinetic data or study details for rimonabant. |
| PD | unknown_2011 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The provided text is only a conference header and contains no data, analysis, or mention of rimonabant pharmacodynamics. |
| popPK | unknown_2016 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The provided evidence is only a title for a conference abstract collection and contains no specific study data, parameters, or text regarding rimonabant pharmacokinetics. |
| PD | unknown_2016 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The provided text is only the title of a conference abstract collection and contains no specific data, models, or parameters for rimonabant. |
