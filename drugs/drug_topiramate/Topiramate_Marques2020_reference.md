<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The topiramate record from Marques_2020 was rejected because the absorption rate constant ka is reported as 127 % and clearance CL as 65 %, dimensionally invalid values for these parameters.**

The record was built from the paper's abstract alone, so reported summary statistics stood in for a fitted model. In that source, ka (absorption rate constant) is given as 127 with unit '%' and CL (total clearance) as 65 with unit '%', a dimension mismatch on structural parameters since a rate constant and a clearance cannot be percentages. Only the volume of distribution V = 3.22 L is dimensionally consistent. Extracted — topiramate: V 3.22 L, kabs 127 %, CL 65 %.

**Parameters:** 3 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Serum creatinine (mg/dl)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Marques_2020:abstract'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Gestational age (wk)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Marques_2020:abstract'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Apgar (1 min)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Marques_2020:abstract'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Apgar (5 min)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Marques_2020:abstract'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Apgar (10 min)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Marques_2020:abstract'])
- dropped value-less row: 'ka (h−1)' (captured trailing unit 'h−1' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'CL (L/h)' (captured trailing unit 'L/h' for child rows)
- covariate wt for CL from footnote/prose kept as documentation only (['Marques_2020:abstract'])
- covariate wt for V from footnote/prose kept as documentation only (['Marques_2020:abstract'])
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'ka (%)' → Q49 (unit 'dimensionless' vs ontology '1 / [time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'CL and CL (%)' → Q22 (unit 'dimensionless' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'V (%)' → Q61 (unit 'dimensionless' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q61 ('V (%)', value '38') — already have one for this compound
- dropped value-less row: 'Correlation ka‐CL and CL (%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Correlation ka‐V (%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Marques_2020:abstract'])
- dropped value-less row: 'Correlation CL and CL ‐V(%)' (captured trailing unit '%' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'λ'
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q61 (V (L)); Q22 (CL and CL (%))
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=topiramate
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from cached Marques_2020_extracted.txt (19 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
