## About

Hydroxocobalamin, a vitamin B12 preparation, is used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency such as pernicious anemia and certain neuropathies, and also serves as an antidote for poisoning. It is an approved medicine included on the WHO essential medicines list, and an EMA-authorised product is available in the European Union for treating poisoning.

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
