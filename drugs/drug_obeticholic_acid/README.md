## About

**Description.** Primary biliary cirrhosis, or PBC, is a progressive and chronic condition that leads to hepatic injury often resulting in end-stage liver failure that requires liver transplantation.[A192786]

Obeticholic acid is a farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) agonist used to treat this condition, possibly allowing for increased survival.[A18696]  In 2016, it was granted approval to treat primary biliary cholangitis in combination with [ursodeoxycholic acid], which was previously the mainstay treatment for this condition.[A18696,L12633] In May 2021, the FDA updated its prescribing information to contraindicate the use of obeticholic acid in patients with PBC and advanced cirrhosis (e.g. those with portal hypertension or hepatic decompensation) due to a risk of liver failure, in some cases requiring liver transplantation.[L34650] 

Obeticholic acid is currently being considered for FDA approval to treat fibrosis caused by non-alcoholic liver steatohepatitis (NASH). The NDA from Intercept Pharmaceuticals was approved in November 2019 and obeticholic acid is expected to be granted full approval for this indication in 2020.[L12636]

**Indication.** Obeticholic acid is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA. It is also used as a monotherapy in adults with PBC that are unable to tolerate UDCA.[L12633]

Obeticholic acid is currently being considered for FDA approval to treat fibrosis caused by non-alcoholic liver steatohepatitis (NASH), and is likely to be approved for this indication in 2020.[L12636]
