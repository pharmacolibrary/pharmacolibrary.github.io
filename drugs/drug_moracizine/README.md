<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| popPK | Rozenshtraukh_1985 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies ethacizin (an analog of ethmozine), not moracizine, and does not report quantitative PK parameters for the target drug. |
