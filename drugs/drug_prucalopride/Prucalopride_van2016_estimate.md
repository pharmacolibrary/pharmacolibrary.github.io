A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**Rejected because the prucalopride absorption parameter t1/2ka carries a half-life meaning but the value 0.792 h−1 is a rate constant, a dimension mismatch on a structural parameter, and the record lacks a clearance value.**

The parameter labelled K a1 (h−1) with value 0.792 h−1 is described as the half-life of the absorption phase, so the reported unit and meaning conflict in dimensions, triggering the structural-parameter mismatch. The record also omits prucalopride clearance: a second reader extracted 22.9 l h−1 for it, while this record has no value. The second reader further disagrees on k a2, reading no value where this record gives 3.87 h−1, and on the precision of Q, V2 and V3, for which this record has no relative standard errors while the second reader reports 15%, 3.3% and 7.9% respectively. Extracted — prucalopride: V2 446, Q 16.9, V3 248, t1/2ka 0.792 h−1, k21 3.87 h−1, MTT 0.734 h, Fab 0.858.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of clpru‐usa‐12 (l h-1)a: this record has none, the second reading 22.9; it also differs on 5 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'CLPRU‐USA‐12 (l h−1)a' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['prp2236-tbl-0003:row2:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'CLSPD555‐303 (l h−1)a' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['prp2236-tbl-0003:row3:col1'])
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'K a1 (h−1)' → Q95 (unit '1 / [time]' vs ontology '[time]') — route to review
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=prucalopride
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'estimate' subgroup of van_2016 (paper reports 3 populations: estimate, pru‐usa‐12, spd555‐303)
- skipped review gap-fill of CL: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- companion parameter table 4 transcribed (29 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 3, 4
