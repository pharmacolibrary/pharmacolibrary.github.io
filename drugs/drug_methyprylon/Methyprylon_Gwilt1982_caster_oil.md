<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

> **Species: dog.** This record comes from an animal study (dog), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from the LLM relevance screen, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> ℹ️ No reviewer record yet — status shown is the scholar **validate** result; simulation-based reviewer checks have not been run.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="methyprylon" model-id="Methyprylon_Gwilt1982_caster_oil" status="rejected" stale="false" population="intoxicated beagle dogs" measured-compound="methyprylon" parameterization="mechanistic" topology="2C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 2-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 9 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'α (hr-1)' → Q67 (unit '1 / [time]' vs ontology '[mass] / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q47 ('K10 (hr-1)', value '1.45') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'mg hr/liter' (AUC)
- implicit units: 'Total area under plasma-time curve, (mg hr/liter)' → mg·h/L (from the paper text: "Table II lists 'Total area under plasma-time curve, (mg hr/liter) = 940.19', i.e., mg·hr/liter.")
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=methyprylon
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'caster oil (n = 5)' subgroup of Gwilt_1982 (paper reports 2 populations: caster oil (n = 5), control* (n = 5))

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
