## About

**Description.** Brivaracetam is a racetam derivative of levetiracetam used in the treatment of partial-onset seizures. Brivaracetam binds SV2A with 20 times higher affinity than levetiracetam [A19184]. It is available under the brand name Briviact made by UCB. Briviact received FDA approval on February 19, 2016 [L760].

**Indication.** Used as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in patients 16 years of age or older.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
