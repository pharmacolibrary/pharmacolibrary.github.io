The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Sakamoto_1987 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study reports in-vitro receptor binding parameters (KD, Bmax) rather than pharmacokinetic disposition parameters. |
| PD | Sakamoto_1987 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports in vitro receptor binding affinity (KD, Bmax) and competition data, which are pharmacological binding parameters, not pharmacodynamic exposure-response or dose-response relationships for drug effects in vivo or in a functional assay. |
| popPK | Sakamoto_1987_2 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study focuses on in-vitro/ex-vivo monoamine uptake mechanisms and qualitative CNS penetration, without reporting quantitative PK parameters like clearance, volume, or half-life. |
| popPK | Shin_2007 | relevant | 8 | 2 | The study reports pharmacokinetic parameters for quinupramine in rats, but the specific numeric values for clearance, volume, or half-life are not present in the provided abstract text. |
