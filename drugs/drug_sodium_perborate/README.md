## About

**Description.** Perboric acid is mainly found in its salt form of sodium perborate and it can be found as a monohydrate or tetrahydrate.[A33037] It is one of the peroxy acid salts with very wide functionalities in industrial settings.[F66] Perboric acid in the form of sodium perborate is approved by Health Canada since 2004 to be used as a disinfectant of medical instruments.[L1113] By the FDA, sodium perborate is approved as an ointment for the protection of poison ivy dermatitis.[L2764]

**Indication.** In the industry, sodium perborate is used as a disinfectant. It is also part of the ingredients for detergents, bleach powders, and personal care formulations. In cosmetic products, perboric acid and mainly its salt are used as an oxidizing agent for dyeing or permanent waving.[F66] 

In dentistry, sodium perborate monohydrate is used as an aid for the removal of phlegm, mucus or other secretions associated with an occasional sore in the mouth, for cleansing minor wounds, for temporary cleanse of canker sore or for the removal of foreign materials in minor wounds.[L2770]

In ophthalmic preparations, sodium perborate is used as a preservative for products used for dry eye. This use is approved as this compound rapidly degrades to harmless byproducts.[T203]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
