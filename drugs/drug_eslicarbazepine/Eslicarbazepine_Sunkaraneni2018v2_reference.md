**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**The eslicarbazepine pediatric model was held back because the builder invented an absorption rate constant (ka) not reported in the source, a deviation judged not acceptable.**

The paper does not report an absorption rate constant (ka) or lag time, so placeholder values were substituted for them, and this invented absorption was judged not acceptable. The model also assumes F=1 and Fm=1 with no molar correction, so CL (2.92 L/h) and V/F (4.78 L) are apparent parameterizations for extravascular dosing. Additionally, the covariate effects (theta_cl_category 25.6 L/h, theta_q49_category 0.895) were not exercised: only the reference individual was simulated, not the covariate scenarios the record defines. One reported unit could not be converted to SI, so that parameter entered simulation without an SI value. Extracted — eslicarbazepine: CL 2.92 L/h, V/F 4.78 L, Frel 6.76.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `needs_review` (reviewed 2026-09-28 14:37:58.501305+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 07:38:45.099389+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['ka', 'Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)
- `invented_absorption`: ka defaulted — not reported in source
- `input_model`: first-order depot input — apparent (/F) parameterization ⇒ extravascular dosing

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'CL: apparent elimination clearance (L/h)' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability/residual variabilitya')
- table section iiv: 'V: apparent volume of distribution (L)' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability/residual variabilitya')
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'RV CCV component' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab3:row9:col1', 'Tab3:row9:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'RV additive component' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab3:row10:col1', 'Tab3:row10:col2'])
- covariate effect for Q22 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- dropped duplicate covariate effect 'category'/'' on Q22 — ambiguous identity (two shifts cannot share one category)
- covariate effect for Q49 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- dropped duplicate covariate effect 'category'/'' on Q49 — ambiguous identity (two shifts cannot share one category)
- metabolite eslicarbazepine: Q27→Q351 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=eslicarbazepine
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment (site presystemic: 'Following oral administration, ESL undergoes rapid first-pass hydrolysis to the primary active metabolite eslicarbazepin')
- 1C volume normalization: Q290→Q76 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'V: apparent volume of distribution (L)' is the general volume)
- row roles: 2 per-group rows of eslicarbazepine absorption_rate_constant but 0 reference group(s) — kept as printed
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 9/9 row label(s) assigned, 8 linked by role
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
