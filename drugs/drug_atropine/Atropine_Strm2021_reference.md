<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The atropine two-compartment horse model was quarantined because clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, absorption lag time and both intercompartmental rate constants had no extracted values and library placeholder defaults were substituted.**

The record lists fitted values for atropine (V1 0.646, V2 1.148, CL 1.905, Q 2.477, Fab 0.781, kabs 5.948), but the model builder's substitutions show Cl, Vd, ka, Tlag, k12 and k21 were left at library placeholder defaults because the source reported no values, and the invented absorption (defaulted ka) was judged not acceptable. Additionally, a reported unit could not be converted to SI, so one parameter reached the build without an SI value. A second reader also disagreed on the eye-drop bioavailability, reading 0.685 where this record has null. Extracted — atropine: V1 0.646, V2 1.15, CL 1.91, Q 2.48, Fab 0.781 ilogit, eye drop, kabs 5.95, t1/2ka 0.117, t1/2β 0.798 terminal phase, … (+3).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of bioavailability drop: this record has none, the second reading 0.685; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'units' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'ilogit, eye drop' (Fab)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'ilogit, infusion' (Fab)
- dropped duplicate Q40 ('tvfINF (ilogit, infusion)', value '0.738') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'terminal phase' (t1/2β)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'initial phase' (t1/2α)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'steady-state volume of distribution' (Vss)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'Mean residence time (IV' (MRT)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=atropine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell Tab1:row12:col1 = 'Scalar (0–1)'
- unparsed cell Tab1:row13:col1 = 'Scalar (0–1)'
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 1
