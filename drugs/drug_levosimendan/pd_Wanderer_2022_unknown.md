<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Levosimendan (concentrations from the PK model of Bertin_2025) drives vasorelaxation (in %): direct Emax (saturable) effect.

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

> Levosimendan (M concentrations) directly stimulates dose-dependent vasorelaxation of rat basilar artery segments, described by an Emax model with Emax 103% and pD2 (−log10EC50) 5.38; the paper reports the altered contraction appeared non-competitive (unchanged pD2) and does not state a mechanistic production/elimination model.

- **paper:** `Wanderer_2022`
- **model family:** `emax`

The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

## Exposure-response model

`Levosimendan_Wanderer2022_PD_unknown` — sigmoid_emax, `response = E0 + Emax*frac`

| parameter | value (paper units) | SI |
|---|---|---|
| E0 | 0 | — |
| Emax | 103 % | 1.03 1 |
| EC50 | 5.38 -log10EC50 | — |
| gamma | 1 | — |

Closed-form check points (response, SI): `at_0` = 0, `at_EC50` = 0.515, `at_inf` = 1.03

Deviations:

- `defaulted_parameters` — E0, gamma
- `pd_binding_exposure_unit_unresolved` — '-log10EC50' — the x axis is in the paper's unit, not SI

## Review

Verdict <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span> · route to `scholar`

| check | status | note |
|---|---|---|
| `T0_driver` | pass | driver is the drug, a synonym or one of its metabolites (or unnamed) |
| `T1_closed_form` | pass | engineer's check points reproduced from the bound parameters |
| `T1b_fmu` | skipped | template FMU / fmpy not available — advisory only |
| `T2_direction` | pass | curve direction matches effect_direction |
| `T3_plausibility` | pass | EC50, gamma, Imax and baseline in range |
| `T4_defaults` | fail | a core parameter took a library default: E0 |

Advisory:

- defaulted: E0 — a row the paper has and the record lacks
- exposure unit not resolved to SI — the x axis is in the paper's unit
