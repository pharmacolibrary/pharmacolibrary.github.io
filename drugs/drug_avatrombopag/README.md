## About

**Description.** Avatrombopag (_Doptelet_), is an orally administered, small molecule thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) agonist that increases platelet number without increasing platelet activation,[A33097,L2824] thereby decreasing the need for blood transfusions.[L2824] Patients with thrombocytopenia and chronic liver disease often require platelet transfusions before surgical procedures to decrease the risk of bleeding.[A33095] Thrombocytopenia is a common complication in patients suffering from chronic liver disease, occurring as a result of liver disease or a consequence of interferon-based antiviral therapy.[F95]

Avatrombopag was first approved by the FDA in May 2018 for use in adults with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure.[L2931] It is administered orally as the salt form avatrombopag maleate.[L2927] _Doptelet_ (Avatrombopag) is the first orally administered treatment option for patients with chronic liver disease,  allowing a large population of patients to avoid a platelet transfusion before a procedure by increasing platelet counts to the optimal level ≥50,000 per microliter.[L2932]

In July 2025, the FDA expanded approval to include a new pediatric formulation, Doptelet Sprinkle (avatrombopag oral granules), specifically designed for children aged one to less than six years, while the existing tablet formulation remains indicated for patients aged six years and older. This approval was supported by results from the AVA-PED-301 phase 3 study, which demonstrated durable platelet responses and favorable safety in children with persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia.[L53688, L53683]

**Indication.** Indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in pediatric patients 1 year and older with persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment [L53683]. It is also indicated in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure [L49941], as well as in adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment [L49941]

<summary>What the PGx columns mean</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>gene</code></td><td>the gene whose variants the record is about. One record per gene, so a paper reporting several genes appears on several rows.</td></tr><tr><td><code>affects</code></td><td>the PK or PD parameter the genotype SHIFTS, as an ontology Q-code plus its name — Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F (apparent clearance), Q32 = Cmax, Q88 = AUC, Q40 = Fab, Q321 = EC50, Q322 = IC50, Q305 = kfm. The record's per-phenotype theta is a multiplier ON that parameter: a poor-metaboliser theta shifts this value, it does not supply one. Two values are NOT parameters — Q100 (NIL) is an association or risk finding with no parameter target, and `safety` is an adverse-reaction risk such as an HLA allele. A PA… id instead of a Q-code marks a record derived from a ClinPGx/PharmGKB guideline lookup rather than read out of the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>mechanism</code></td><td>how the gene acts: metabolism, transport, target, formation, safety_allele, or unknown.</td></tr><tr><td><code>detail</code></td><td>the paper stem, linking to the full record page.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
