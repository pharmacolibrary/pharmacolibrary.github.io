## About

Furosemide is a loop diuretic used to treat fluid build-up caused by heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or kidney disease, and is also used for high blood pressure. It is widely used in human medicine, appears on the WHO essential medicines list, and is also approved for veterinary use.

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
