<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Glucose drives name (in unknown) (stimulation; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> In McArdle mouse myotubes, exogenous glucose (0.35–10 g/L) stimulated lactate production, with a significant dose effect in McArdle myotubes (p = 0.008) and higher lactate appearance at 10 g/L versus the lowest doses, while no significant dose effect was seen in wild-type myotubes (p = 0.270); the paper does not state a pharmacodynamic model or potency/rate parameters (no Imax, IC50, EC50, Emax, kin, kout, ke0, gamma).

- **paper:** `Valenzuela_2024`
- **model family:** `unknown`

## Models

<p>No downloads: this record is <b>rejected</b>, so it is not published as a model. Any archives generated for it before the verdict have been removed — a download outlives the page that explains it.</p>

_No web simulator for this record: its structure has no shared WebAssembly template. The FMI archive under **Models** carries its own compiled FMU._
