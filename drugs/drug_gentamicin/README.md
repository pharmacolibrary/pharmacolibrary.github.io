## About

**Description.** Gentamicin is a bactericidal aminoglycoside that was discovered and isolated from _Micromonospora purpurea_ in 1963.[A234349] It is one of the most frequently prescribed aminoglycosides due to its spectrum of activity, low cost, and availability.[A234339,A234354] Gentamicin is effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms but is particularly useful for the treatment of severe gram-negative infections including those caused by _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_.[A233325,A234359,A234364] There is the added benefit of synergy when gentamicin is co-administered with other antibacterials such as beta-lactams.[A234364] This synergistic activity is not only important for the treatment of complex infections, but can also contribute to dose optimization and reduced adverse effects.[A234359,A234364]

Although gentamicin is well-established and may be used in a variety of clinical applications, it is also associated with severe adverse effects including nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity which may limit its use.[A234369]

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
