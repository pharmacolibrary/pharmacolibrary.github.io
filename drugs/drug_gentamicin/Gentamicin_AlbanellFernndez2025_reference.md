A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for gentamicin's clearance and volume of distribution.**

The model was built, but gentamicin's clearance and volume of distribution had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. Extracted — gentamicin: V 0.66.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has vancomycin, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

**Model structure:** 1-compartment, IV mammillary model — template `PK_1C`.  
**Parameters:** 1 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q61 ('V d equation', value None) — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('CL equation', value None) — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=vancomycin
