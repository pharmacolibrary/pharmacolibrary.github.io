**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The metamizole model was quarantined because metamizole's elimination clearance and intercompartmental clearance had no extracted values and were replaced by library placeholders, while all 7 extracted parameters describe naproxen, not metamizole.**

Every extracted parameter (kabs 0.538, V1/F 3.27 L, k12 0.185, k14 1.334, kel 0.213, kcomp 0.009, t1/2z 1.708 h) belongs to naproxen, so metamizole's own disposition is uncharacterized. Metamizole's elimination clearance and intercompartmental clearance had no source values, so standard library placeholder values stood in and the model was held back rather than published with invented numbers. The parameter-coverage check expected 5 parameters emitted or defaulted but covered only 4, with V1/F neither emitted nor defaulted. Additionally, the reported unit 'n = 7' could not be converted to SI, and the builder assumed F=1 and Fm=1 with no molar correction (apparent parameterization). Extracted — naproxen: kabs 0.538 n = 7, V1/F 3.27 L, k12 0.185 n = 7, k14 1.33 n = 7, kel 0.213 n = 7, kcomp 0.009 n = 7, t1/2z 1.71 h.

**Model structure:** 2-compartment general linear model (non-mammillary edges) — template `PK_General_Linear`.  
**Parameters:** 7 extracted.

**Parameterization:** V1/F, V2/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `model_quarantined`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Metamizole (n = 8)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T3:row0:col2', 'T3:row0:col3'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 7' (kabs)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 7' (k12)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 7' (k14)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 7' (kel)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'n = 7' (kcomp)
- dropped duplicate Q48 ('k24 (1/h)', value '2.275') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('T1/2 4-MAA (h)', value None) — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('T1/2 4-AA (h)', value '2.14') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('T1/2 4-AAA (h)', value '1.00') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('T1/2 4-FAA (h)', value None) — already have one for this compound
- dropped PD-category row 'EC50 (µM)' → Q321 (EC50, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['T3:row20:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'N' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T3:row21:col3'])
- dropped PD-category row 'E0 b' → Q324 (E0, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['T3:row22:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Emax b' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T3:row23:col3'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=4-methylaminoantipyrine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: 4 first-order transfer(s) across 5 compounds → general_linear
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'naproxen (n = 7)' subgroup of Blaser_2021 (paper reports 2 populations: metamizole (n = 8), naproxen (n = 7))
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures '4-methylaminoantipyrine', not metamizole — the review values are the parent's
