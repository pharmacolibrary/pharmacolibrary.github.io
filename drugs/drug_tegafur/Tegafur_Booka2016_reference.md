<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> ℹ️ No reviewer record yet — status shown is the scholar **validate** result; simulation-based reviewer checks have not been run.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `S-1`, measured `5-FU`.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="tegafur" model-id="Tegafur_Booka2016_reference" status="rejected" stale="false" population="cancer patients with various degrees of renal function" measured-compound="5-FU" parameterization="apparent" topology="general_linear"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** general linear; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 2 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CLm/F, Vm/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

| label (paper) | Q-code · name | value | unit | value_si | unit_canonical | RSE% | link | source | covariates | IIV |

<summary>Column legend — what each column means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label (paper)</code></td><td>the row or statistic label exactly as printed in the paper (label_verbatim) — never normalised, so it can be found in the PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Q-code · name</code></td><td>the ontology parameter this label was matched to (Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F, Q49 = ka, Q57 = half-life, …) and its canonical name. The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- compound tags: 3 row(s) → 5-FU, 3 row(s) → tegafur (name 6)
- table section iiv: '5-FU' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (%)')
- table section iiv: 'CDHP' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (%)')
- table section iiv: 'Tegafur' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (%)')
- column 'parameter' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): '5-FU' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab2:row1:col1', 'Tab2:row1:col2'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'L/h/m2' (CL/F)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'L/m2' (V/F)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'CDHP' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab2:row5:col1', 'Tab2:row5:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Tegafur' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab2:row9:col1', 'Tab2:row9:col2'])
- implicit units: 'CL/F (L/h/m2)' — the LLM proposed 'L/h/m2', whose dimension does not fit Q27; left unset
- implicit units: 'V/F (L/m2)' — the LLM proposed 'L/m2', whose dimension does not fit Q76; left unset
- metabolite 5-fu: Q27→Q351 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- metabolite 5-fu: Q76→Q367 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=5-FU
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- template fit: none — 3 metabolites — the templates hold two
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 0/6 row label(s) assigned, 0 linked by role
- molar mass: no plausible PubChem entry for 'S-1' ('S-1') — left in mass units
- molar mass: none found for 'S-1' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures '5-FU', not tegafur — the review values are the parent's

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell Tab2:row2:col1 = '(21.9 + 0.375 × CLcr) × BSA'
- unparsed cell Tab2:row3:col1 = '362 × BSA'
- unparsed cell Tab2:row6:col1 = '(3.77 + 0.403 × CLcr) × BSA'
- unparsed cell Tab2:row7:col1 = '200 × BSA'
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
