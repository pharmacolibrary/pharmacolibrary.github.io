> **Species: rat.** This record comes from an animal study (rat), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The tegafur parent–metabolite model for Sprague-Dawley rats fails to reproduce the paper's terminal half-life (2.3 h vs 3.23 h) and tmax (1.7 h vs 3.06 h), uses a defaulted ka, and its structure does not match the reported parent–metabolite topology, so it was rejected.**

Simulated as the paper dosed it, the model's terminal half-life is 3.23 h against the paper's 2.3 h (ratio 1.4027) and its tmax is 3.06 h against 1.7 h (ratio 1.7981); other reported tmax values (0.6 h, 1.2 h) and half-lives (1.2 h, 0.32166666666666666 h) also miss by ratios up to 10.0294. The model structure is a one-compartment enteral model rather than the parent–metabolite structure linking tegafur to 5-FU via Kfm, and the simulated output is the parent compartment rather than the measured analyte. The absorption rate constant ka and Tlag were left at library defaults instead of values from the paper, and bioavailability was assumed F=1 with Fm=1 and no molar correction, giving an apparent parameterization. One reported unit could not be converted to SI, so that parameter reached the model builder without an SI value. Extracted — tegafur: AUClast 4.68e+04 ng·h/mL, AUC∞ 4.75e+04 ng·h/mL, CL/F 1.8 mL/min/kg, V/F 0.5 L/kg, tmax 2.4 h.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['ka', 'Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)
- `invented_absorption`: ka defaulted — not reported in source
- `input_model`: first-order depot input — apparent (/F) parameterization ⇒ extravascular dosing

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Tegafur' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Kim_2017_table_1:row1:col4', 'Kim_2017_table_1:row1:col5'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): '5-FU' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Kim_2017_table_1:row8:col4', 'Kim_2017_table_1:row8:col5'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Gimeracil' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Kim_2017_table_1:row14:col4', 'Kim_2017_table_1:row14:col5'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=tegafur
- population split: 'multiple dose' subgroup of Kim_2017 (paper reports 6 populations: multiple dose, parameter, population mean (bsv), single dose, symbol, unit)
- engineer: parent → metabolite not buildable on PK_3M_9C (None) — the measured compound's 1-compartment model instead
