A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**Only volume was extracted — no clearance.**

A model needs both clearance and volume; without the clearance it could only be built on a library default, so it was not. Extracted — canrenone: V1 115 L.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the links between molecules: this record has spironolactone → 7-alpha-thiomethylspironolactone (metabolism); spironolactone → canrenone (metabolism), the second reading spironolactone → tms (metabolism); spironolactone → canrenone (metabolism); it also differs on 2 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- linked 'VTMS=VCAN' as 'Vc' → Q63 (V1) for  — compound marker removed
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'CLTMS' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Lass_2024_table_3:row1:col1'])
- implicit units: 'VTMS=VCAN' → L (from the paper text: "The table footnote defines 'VTMS, volume of distribution for TMS (L)' and 'VCAN, volume of distribution for CAN (L)'. Th")
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=spironolactone
- topology: 2 first-order transfer(s) across 3 compounds → general_linear
- template fit: PK_3M_9C — formed from central; parent 1, metabolites [0, 0]
- model equation 'CL_SP/F = Θ2 x (CW/4300)^0.75 x (PNA/60)^Θ3' not bound — neither LHS nor base term 'x' linked to an ontology parameter
- model equation 'CL_TMS = Θ5 x (CW/4300)^0.75' not bound — neither LHS nor base term 'x' linked to an ontology parameter
- model equation 'CL_CAN = Θ6 x (CW/4300)^0.75' not bound — neither LHS nor base term 'x' linked to an ontology parameter
- population split: 'estimate 1' subgroup of Lass_2024 (paper reports 2 populations: estimate 1, estimate 2)
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 19/19 row label(s) assigned, 15 linked by role; re-tagged parent→canrenone ×6, parent→7-alpha-thiomethylspironolactone ×9
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures 'spironolactone', not canrenone — the review values are the parent's

**Extraction notes:**
- final table tab_0: grid unusable → re-running vision table extraction for Lass_2024
- final table tab_0: no readable grid (GROBID mangled)
- companion parameter table 2 transcribed (21 record(s), model stage 'final')
- companion parameter table 3 transcribed (14 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2, 3
- captured model equation CL_SP/F = Θ2 x (CW/4300)^0.75 x (PNA/60)^Θ3
- captured model equation CL_TMS = Θ5 x (CW/4300)^0.75
- captured model equation CL_CAN = Θ6 x (CW/4300)^0.75
