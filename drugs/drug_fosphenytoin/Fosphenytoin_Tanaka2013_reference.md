A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**V3 has no unit.**

Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. A reported unit could not be converted (V3), so that value has no SI equivalent. None of the extracted parameters is fosphenytoin's own; they describe phenytoin. Extracted — phenytoin: CL 1.61 L/h, V1 20.3 L, Q 53.4 L/h, V2 26.5 L, V3 0.591 V3, kfm 4.96 1/h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the links between molecules: this record has fosphenytoin sodium → phenytoin (metabolism), the second reading none; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `fosphenytoin`, measured `phenytoin`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'ΘWT (CL)' → Q22 (unit '[length] ** 3' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('ΘWT (CL)', value '0.575') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'V3' (V3)
- implicit units: 'CL (L/h)a' → L/h (from the paper text: "The text states: 'The basic pharmacokinetic parameters were total clearance (CL, L/h)'. Additionally, Table 3 lists 'Pop")
- implicit units: 'V2 (L)a' → L (from the paper text: "The text states: 'central volume of distribution (V2, L)'. Additionally, Table 3 lists 'V2 (L)a'.")
- implicit units: 'V3 (L)a' → L (from the paper text: "The text states: 'peripheral volume of distribution (V3, L)'. Additionally, Table 3 lists 'V3 (L)a'.")
- implicit units: 'K12 (1/h)' → 1/h (from the paper text: "The text states: 'metabolism rate constant (K12, h−1)'. Note: h−1 is equivalent to 1/h.")
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=phenytoin
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- template fit: PK_3M_9C — formed from central; parent 0, metabolites [3]
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 14/14 row label(s) assigned, 30 linked by role
