The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Parameters:** 6 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'CL (ml/min)' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter individual variability (CV %)')
- table section iiv: 'VC (ml)' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter individual variability (CV %)')
- table section iiv: 'Ka2 (min⁻¹)' routed out of structural estimates ('Inter individual variability (CV %)')
- dropped value-less row: 'CL (ml/min)' (captured trailing unit 'ml/min' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'VC (ml)' (captured trailing unit 'ml' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'Ka 1 (min⁻¹)' (captured trailing unit 'min⁻¹' for child rows)
- dropped value-less row: 'Ka2 (min⁻¹)' (captured trailing unit 'min⁻¹' for child rows)
- salvaged Q22 ('population clearance'=930) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q63 ('central volume of distribution'=134) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=bupivacaine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- model equation 'θi = TV (θi)* exp (ηθi)' not bound — neither LHS nor base term 'TV' linked to an ontology parameter
- 1C volume normalization: Q63→Q61 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'central volume of distribution' is the general volume)
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Storgaard_2024's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- final table T2: grid unusable → re-running vision table extraction for Eljebari_2014
- unparsed cell Eljebari_2014_table_p4_1:row0:col1 = 'θ₁=930 (930±282.24)'
- unparsed cell Eljebari_2014_table_p4_1:row1:col1 = 'θ₂=134 000 (134000±33510)'
- unparsed cell Eljebari_2014_table_p4_1:row2:col1 = 'θ₃=0.0046 (0.0046±0.0023)'
- unparsed cell Eljebari_2014_table_p4_1:row3:col1 = 'θ₄=0.292 (0.292±0.162)'
- captured model equation θi = TV (θi)* exp (ηθi)
