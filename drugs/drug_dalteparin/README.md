<summary>Badge legend — what each badge means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| popPK | Abe_2013 | relevant | 10 | 2 | The paper describes a population PK model for dalteparin, but specific numeric parameter values (CL, V, ka) are not present in the provided abstract text. |
| popPK | Bergqvist_2004 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of melagatran/ximelagatran, with dalteparin serving only as a comparator agent for efficacy and safety. |
| PGx | Mälarstig_2006 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the prognostic value of sCD40L levels and CD40LG SNPs on clinical outcomes (MI risk) and their interaction with dalteparin treatment efficacy, but it does not report changes in dalteparin's pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters (e.g., anti-Xa activity, clearance, half-life) based on genotype. |
| PGx | Mälarstig_2008 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates IL-10 genetics and cardiovascular outcomes, not the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of dalteparin. |
| popPK | Nylander_2003 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in vitro mechanistic investigation of platelet activation inhibition, not a pharmacokinetic study, and reports no disposition parameters for dalteparin. |
| PGx | Risselada_2013 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper describes a drug-drug interaction (carbamazepine and rivaroxaban) and does not report any pharmacogenomic effects on dalteparin. |
| popPK | Schoemaker_1996 | relevant | 8 | 2 | The paper is a methodological study using dalteparin as one of three examples for population PK modeling, but the specific numeric parameter values for dalteparin are not present in the provided text (only values for an anti-hypertensive drug and enoxaparin are shown). |
| PGx | Verso_2021 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates drug-drug interactions with anticancer agents, not pharmacogenomic effects of gene variants on dalteparin PK/PD. |
| popPK | Yu_2018 | irrelevant | 2 | 2 | The study reports pharmacodynamic parameters (Anti-Xa/IIa activity) and bioequivalence ratios, but does not report quantitative pharmacokinetic disposition parameters (CL, V, Q) for dalteparin itself. |
