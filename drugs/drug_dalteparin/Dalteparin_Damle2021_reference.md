<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The dalteparin two-compartment model was rejected because one compartment is unreachable from the dose: the peripheral compartment (V2/F = 7180 mL) is unlinked, so no drug can reach it.**

The record describes dalteparin in pediatric venous thromboembolism patients with a two-compartment structure, first-order absorption (kabs = 1.04 1/h) and clearance CL/F = 929 mL/h. The volume parameter V2/F = 7180 mL is defined as the volume of the peripheral compartment, but the model structure leaves that compartment without a path from the dose, making it an orphan compartment. No other failed checks or builder deviations are reported. Extracted — dalteparin: CL/F 929, V2/F 7.18e+03, kabs 1.04, V/F 1.

**Model structure:** 2-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 4 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F, V2/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'WT in CL/F θ6' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['jcph1716-tbl-0002:row5:col1'])
- dropped value-less row: 'AGE in CL/F θ8'
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'SEX = 1 in CL/F θ14' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['jcph1716-tbl-0002:row8:col1', 'jcph1716-tbl-0002:row8:col2', 'jcph1716-tbl-0002:row8:col3'])
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('CANCERST = 1 in CL/F θ15', value '0.885') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=anti-Xa
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
