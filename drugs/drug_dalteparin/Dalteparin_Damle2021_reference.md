A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The dalteparin two-compartment model was rejected because one compartment is unreachable from the dose: the peripheral compartment (V2/F = 7180 mL) is unlinked, so no drug can reach it.**

The record describes dalteparin in pediatric venous thromboembolism patients with a two-compartment structure, first-order absorption (kabs = 1.04 1/h) and clearance CL/F = 929 mL/h. The volume parameter V2/F = 7180 mL is defined as the volume of the peripheral compartment, but the model structure leaves that compartment without a path from the dose, making it an orphan compartment. No other failed checks or builder deviations are reported. Extracted — dalteparin: CL/F 929, V2/F 7.18e+03, kabs 1.04, V/F 1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the links between molecules: this record has none, the second reading dalteparin → anti-xa (none). That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by glm-5.3-flash</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-09-28 14:37:27.644184+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-05 14:09:39.459714+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `dalteparin`, measured `anti-Xa`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('WT in CL/F θ6', value '0.75') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q76 ('WT in V/F θ7', value '1') — already have one for this compound
- dropped value-less row: 'AGE in CL/F θ8'
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'SEX = 1 in CL/F θ14' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['jcph1716-tbl-0002:row8:col1', 'jcph1716-tbl-0002:row8:col2', 'jcph1716-tbl-0002:row8:col3'])
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('CANCERST = 1 in CL/F θ15', value '0.885') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=anti-Xa
- molar mass: no plausible PubChem entry for 'anti-Xa' ('anti-Xa') — left in mass units
- molar mass: none found for 'dalteparin' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- molar mass: none found for 'anti-Xa' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures 'anti-Xa', not dalteparin — the review values are the parent's
