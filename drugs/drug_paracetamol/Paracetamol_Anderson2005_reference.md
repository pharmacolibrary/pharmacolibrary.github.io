**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The paracetamol record from Anderson_2005 was rejected because a structural parameter carries a dimension mismatch and the metabolite paracetamol, formed from propacetamol, has no path from the dose.**

The parameter labelled 'CL std /F oral ...' was extracted with value 19.3 and unit 'a', a unit that could not be converted to SI, so it reached the record without an SI value and its dimension does not match a structural parameter. The metabolite paracetamol (formed from propacetamol at the central site) has no path from the dose, making it an unlinked metabolite. A second reader also disputed several fields, including the dose compound (propacetamol versus paracetamol), the absence of a propacetamol-to-paracetamol hydrolysis link, and three parameters (72.1, 0.885, 0.476) recorded as null here. Extracted — paracetamol: kfm 0.007 a, CLm/F 1.87 L/h, V2 45 L, V/F 0.82 L/kg.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has propacetamol, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 14 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-10-05 09:29:54.597848+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 06:04:49.390541+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `propacetamol`, measured `paracetamol`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'CL std /F oral (lAEh )1 70 kg )1 ) V 2std /F oral (lAE70 kg )1 ) Q std /F oral (lAEh )1 70 kg )1 ) V 3std /F oral (lAE70 kg )1 )' → Q27 (unit '[time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q900 ('b CL', value '0.885') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'T CL' → Q370 (unit '[length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q900 ('b vol', value '0.476') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'T vol' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row11:col1', 'tab_0:row11:col4'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=paracetamol
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- gap-filled Q76 (V/F) from Anderson_2015's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q83 (tlag) from Gibb_2008's review values (primary lacked it)
