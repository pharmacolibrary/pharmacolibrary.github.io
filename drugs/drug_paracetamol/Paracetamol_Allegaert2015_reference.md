**Model:** A model was generated (see the **Models** tab); it has no in-browser simulator.

### Reviewer guidance

**The paracetamol parent-metabolite model was held back because two parameters, the peripheral volume V2 (22.3 L) and the absorption lag time tlag (4.2 min), were not extracted, so no value was available for them.**

The record covers only 4 of the 6 expected parameters; V2 and tlag were neither emitted nor defaulted, meaning no value was extracted and a library placeholder would have been used for the peripheral volume and absorption lag time. The metabolite structure is otherwise specified, with formation clearances of 2.02 L/h to paracetamol-glucuronide and 3.82 L/h to paracetamol-sulphate. A second reader also disagreed on several values, reading Q as absent rather than 1.34 L/h and assigning a different identifier to the total clearance parameter. Extracted — paracetamol-glucuronide: CLfm 2.02 L/h; paracetamol: CLfm 3.82 L/h, CL 0.94 L/h, V1 1.83 L, V2 22.3 L, V3 23.9 L, Q 1.34 L/h, Q2 61.6 L/h, tlag 4.2 min.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of 34.4: this record has none, the second reading 18.5; it also differs on 3 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.
