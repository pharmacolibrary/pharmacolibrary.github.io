<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
</details>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**Every check that could be run on this record passed.**

A reported unit could not be converted (MTT), so that value has no SI equivalent.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of alag1: this record has none, the second reading 1.42; it also differs on 2 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['Tlag', 'k12']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ALAG1 (h)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row8:col1', 'tab_1:row8:col2', 'tab_1:row8:col3', 'tab_1:row8:col5', 'tab_1:row8:col6'])
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'CL/F ∼Females' → Q27 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('CL/F ∼Females', value '10.4') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'CL/F ∼CP Score 5' → Q27 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('CL/F ∼CP Score 5', value '16.5') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'CL/F ∼East Asians' → Q27 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('CL/F ∼East Asians', value '8.63') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'CL/F ∼ CP Score &gt; 5 †' → Q27 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('CL/F ∼ CP Score &gt; 5 †', value '16.2') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Vc/F ∼South/Central Asians' → Q290 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q290 ('Vc/F ∼South/Central Asians', value '13.2') — already have one for this compound
- routed 'Covar ωCL, ωVc' → Q314 (omega_cov) to covariance — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=eltrombopag
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell tab_1:row15:col3 = '-0.149 to -0.0771'
- unparsed cell tab_1:row15:col6 = '-0.151 to -0.074'

Sliders start at the extracted values; the reference check compares the browser's peak against the FMPy result recorded when the record was built, and is withheld once a value has been edited. Template `PK_2C_enteral` · parameters `Eltrombopag_Farrell2014_reference_params.json` · controls `Eltrombopag_Farrell2014_reference_sim_controls.json`. A slider marked *simulator value* is running on the template's own default because this record does not pin that parameter.</sub>
