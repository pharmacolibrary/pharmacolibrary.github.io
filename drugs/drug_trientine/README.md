## About

**Description.** Triethylenetatramine (TETA), also known as trientine, is a potent and selective copper (II)-selective chelator. It is a structural analog of linear polyamine compounds, [spermidine] and [spermine]. TETA was first developed in Germany in 1861 and its chelating properties were first recognized in 1925.[A19333] Initially approved by the FDA in 1985 as a second-line treatment for Wilson's disease,[A19334] TETA is currently indicated to treat adults with stable Wilson’s disease who are de-coppered and tolerant to [penicillamine].[L41730]

TETA has been investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure in patients with diabetes.[A18804,A19332,A19333,A19334,A19335]

**Indication.** Triethylenetetramine is a copper chelator indicated for the treatment of adult patients with stable Wilson’s disease who are de-coppered and tolerant to [penicillamine].[L41730]
