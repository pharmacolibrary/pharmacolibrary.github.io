> **Species: pig.** This record comes from an animal study (pig), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The gabapentin record from Hampton_2021 was rejected because the clearance parameter carries a dimensionally invalid unit (kg*min) instead of a flow unit, a structural-parameter dimension mismatch.**

The clearance for gabapentin is recorded as 1.2 with unit 'kg*min', which is not a valid unit for a clearance parameter and fails the dimensional check on structural parameters. The record was also built from the paper's abstract alone, so reported summary statistics stood in for a fitted model. A second reader returned null for all extracted values, including clearance 1.2, Vss 594 ml/kg, terminal half-life 360 min, and bioavailability 47%, leaving the extraction unconfirmed. Extracted — gabapentin: V 170 ml/kg, CL 1.2 kg*min, Vss 594 ml/kg, t1/2z 360 min, t1/2ka 58 min, Cmax 9.16e+03 ng/ml, tmax 194 min, Fab 47 %, … (+2).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on bioavailability: this record has 47, the second reading none; it also differs on 10 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'clearance' → Q22 (unit '[mass] * [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=gabapentin
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- 1C volume normalization: Q63→Q61 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'volume of the central compartment' is the general volume)
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Adrian_2018's review values (primary lacked it)
- gap-filled Q83 (tlag) from Adrian_2018's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Hampton_2021_metadata.yaml (8 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
