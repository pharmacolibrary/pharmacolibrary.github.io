A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The gabapentin record was rejected because a structural parameter failed a dimension check — the elimination rate constant kel (0.53 h-1) is dimensionally inconsistent with the macro-rate constant λ2 (1 h-1) — and one reported unit could not be converted to SI.**

The record lists kel (labelled ke1, 0.53 h-1) as the terminal elimination rate constant and λ2 (labelled ke2, 1 h-1) as the slow-phase macro-rate constant of the two-compartment disposition; the dimension check on these structural parameters failed, and one reported unit could not be converted to SI, so that parameter entered model construction without an SI value. A second reader also disagreed on two values: the record carries ke2 as 1 and the eGFR covariate effect on CL/F as 1.34, whereas the second reader left ke2 and the covariate effect unset and instead assigned 1.34 to a power-form eGFR effect on CL/F, so the covariate effect's form and value are not settled. Extracted — gabapentin: tlag 0.34 h, kabs 0.14 h-1, CL/F 10.2 L/h, V1/F 18.2 L, Q 6.58 L/h, V2/F 358 L, kel 0.53 h-1, λ2 1 h-1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of ke2: this record has 1, the second reading none; it also differs on 2 more fields. That field does not shape the model.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- covariate level 'logt (eGFR/84.85) on CL/F' → Q900:logt_egfr_84.85_on_cl_f = 1.34 (power on Q27)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'OCT2 on ke1' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T1:row10:col1'])
- dropped PD-category row 'E0' → Q324 (E0, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['T1:row11:col1'])
- dropped PD-category row 'IC50 (ng/mL)' → Q322 (IC50, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['T1:row12:col1'])
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'ke2 (h-1)' → Q68 (unit '1 / [time]' vs ontology '[mass] / [time]') — route to review
- dropped PD-category row 'Imax' → Q323 (Imax, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['T1:row14:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Additive (a)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T1:row24:col1', 'T1:row26:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Proportional (b)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T1:row27:col1'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=gabapentin
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
