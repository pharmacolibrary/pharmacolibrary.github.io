> **Species: mouse.** This record comes from an animal study (mouse), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Trazodone and gabapentin drive name (in count): direct linear effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Gabapentin (i.p., 1.5–15 mg/kg) and trazodone concentrations act on the acetic-acid stimulus entering the first transit compartment (a0) of a nine-transit-compartment model of writhing counts, reducing the stimulus amplitude by a factor k2·C(t) (linear inhibition, additive for the combination: k2A·CA + k2B·CB). Potency (k2) was 0.0459 L/μmoles/min for gabapentin (trazodone 10.9 L/μmoles/min); transit and elimination rate constants were ktr = 1.36 and k = 0.104 (units not stated), with stimulus S = 26.10.
