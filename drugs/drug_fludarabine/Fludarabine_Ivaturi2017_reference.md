A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The fludarabine parent–metabolite model was rejected because the metabolite f-ara-ATP is unlinked: despite the metabolism link via kfm (0.005 1/h), the metabolite has no reachable compartment (n_cmt 0), so no path from the dose exists.**

The record describes fludarabine in pediatric hematopoietic cell transplant recipients with a metabolite f-ara-ATP formed from the parent, with a formation rate constant kfm of 0.005 1/h and an elimination rate constant kel of 0.09 1/h. However, the metabolite has no compartments (n_cmt 0), so the structure check found an unlinked metabolite with no path from the administered dose. Parent parameters (CL 3.1 L/h, V1 13.4 L/kg, V2 13.4 L) were extracted, but the metabolite side of the topology is incomplete, which is why the model was refused. Extracted — fludarabine: CL 3.1 L/h, V1 13.4 L/kg, V2 13.4 L; f-ara-ATP: kfm 0.005 1/h, kel 0.09 1/h.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('Intercompartmental CL, L/h/kg', value '2.2') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'L/15' (V2)
- dropped PD-category row 'Time effect on kin' → Q327 (kin, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['T2:row8:col1', 'T2:row8:col2', 'T2:row8:col3'])
- dropped diagnostic row 'Interindividual variability on CL§ (% shrinkage)' → Q318 (shrinkage) — reported statistic, not a parameter
- dropped diagnostic row 'Interindividual variability on Vc§ (% shrinkage)' → Q318 (shrinkage) — reported statistic, not a parameter
- dropped diagnostic row 'Interindividual variability on Kin§ (% shrinkage)' → Q318 (shrinkage) — reported statistic, not a parameter
- implicit units: 'Typical value forf-ara-a CL, L/h/15 kg' → L/h (from the paper text: "The text states: 'where, 3.1L/hour is the typical value of f-ara-a CL'.")
- implicit units: 'Vp, L/15' → L (from the popPK convention: 'The parameter is a volume of distribution (Vp). In population PK, volumes are typically expressed in liters (L). The val')
- implicit units: 'Kin†' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'The parameter is a first-order rate constant (Kin). First-order rate constants are expressed in reciprocal time units, t')
- implicit units: 'Kout‡' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'The parameter is a first-order rate constant (Kout). First-order rate constants are expressed in reciprocal time units, ')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=fludarabine
- template fit: PK_3M_9C — formed from central; parent 2, metabolites [0]
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 14/14 row label(s) assigned, 22 linked by role; re-tagged parent→f-ara-ATP ×17
