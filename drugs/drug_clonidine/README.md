## About

Clonidine is a centrally acting alpha-2 agonist used to treat high blood pressure, and also for conditions such as glaucoma, ADHD, Tourette syndrome, spasticity, and hypersalivation. It remains an approved medicine in widespread use, though it carries a boxed warning.

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
