# insulin icodec

- **generic name:** insulin icodec
- **ATC codes:** `A10AE07`

## About

**Description.** Insulin icodec is an ultra long-acting basal insulin analogue. It is a re-engineered version of the ultra long-acting oral basal insulin OI338, with several modifications introduced to significantly extend the half-life.[A264093] These modifications - which cause increased serum albumin binding and attenuated insulin receptor affinity - result in a mean half-life of approximately 196 hours, allowing for once-weekly administration.[L50758,A263818]

Insulin icodec was approved by Health Canada in March 2024 for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus,[L50758] and was subsequently approved by the EMA in May 2024 for the same indication.[L50763] It has also been approved in Japan and Australia.[L51078] In July 2024, the US FDA rejected the approval of insulin icodec, citing concerns regarding hypoglycemia and the indication being sought for type 1 diabetes mellitus.[L51078]

**Indication.** Insulin icodec is indicated for the once-weekly treatment of adults with diabetes mellitus in order to improve glycemic control.[L50758,L50763]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
