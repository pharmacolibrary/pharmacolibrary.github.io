The record's per-phenotype theta is a multiplier ON that parameter: a poor-metaboliser theta shifts this value, it does not supply one. Two values are NOT parameters — Q100 (NIL) is an association or risk finding with no parameter target, and `safety` is an adverse-reaction risk such as an HLA allele.

| popPK | Wahyuningsih_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review on nanocarriers for diabetic wound healing and does not report pharmacokinetic parameters for zinc sulfate. |
| PD | Wahyuningsih_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review on nanocarrier delivery of phytochemicals for diabetic wound healing and does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response data for zinc sulfate. |
| popPK | Weston_1977 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the immunological correction of chemotaxis defects in acrodermatitis enteropathica and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters for zinc sulfate. |
| popPK | Woillard_2014 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of ciclosporin, not zinc_sulfate. |
| PD | Woillard_2014 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses exclusively on pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and Bayesian estimation of Ciclosporin AUC for dose adjustment, with no mention of zinc sulfate or any pharmacodynamic (PD) or exposure-response analysis. |
| PGx | Wu_2003 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports the efficacy of zinc sulfate in Wilson disease patients but does not investigate how specific gene variants affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the drug. |
| popPK | Wuehler_2008 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The study is a clinical trial measuring plasma zinc concentrations and morbidity outcomes, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting quantitative disposition parameters like clearance or volume of distribution. |
| popPK | Yang_2023 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the pharmacokinetics of oxcarbazepine (and its metabolite MHD), not zinc sulfate. |
| PD | Yang_2023 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model for oxcarbazepine's metabolite, not a pharmacodynamic (PD) or exposure-response model, and does not involve zinc sulfate. |
| popPK | de_1992 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a mechanistic cell biology investigation using zinc sulfate as an inducer of gene expression, not a pharmacokinetic study of zinc sulfate disposition. |
| PD | de_1992 | not_relevant | 4 | 2 | The paper describes a qualitative dose-response relationship between zinc sulfate-induced ras protein levels and gap junction loss, but does not provide numeric PD parameters (e.g., EC50, Emax) or a quantitative concentration-effect curve for the drug itself. |
