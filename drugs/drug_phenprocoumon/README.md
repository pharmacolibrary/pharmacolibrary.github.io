## ADME sites

Where this drug is handled, from DrugBank's curated enzymes / transporters / carriers and the KB's PGx genes, mapped to tissue through the ADME gene table. Compare it with other drugs on the [Sites & interactions](sites?drugs=phenprocoumon) page (add drugs there; the set becomes a link).

| process | tissue | actors (role) | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| distribution | blood | `ALB` binder/regulator, `ORM1` unknown | DrugBank actor |
| metabolism | liver | `CYP2C8` substrate, `CYP2C9` substrate, `CYP3A4` substrate | DrugBank actor |

The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
