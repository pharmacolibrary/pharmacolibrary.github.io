## About

**Description.** Vonoprazan is a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB) that inhibits H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-mediated gastric acid secretion. PCABs represent an alternative to proton-pump inhibitors for the treatment of acid-related disorders. Unlike proton-pump inhibitors, PCABs are not affected by CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms and do not require acid-resistant formulations.[A253702] Furthermore, vonoprazan is 350-times more potent than the proton-pump inhibitor [lansoprazole], thanks to its ability to accumulate in the gastric corpus mucosa, specifically in the parietal cells.[A253707] 

In February 2015, vonoprazan was first marketed in Japan for the treatment of acid-related disorders and as an adjunct to _Helicobacter pylori_ (_H. pylori_) eradication.[A253702] In May 2022, the FDA approved the use of vonoprazan in a co-packaged product containing amoxicillin and clarithromycin for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infection.[L41695] Studies have shown that the concomitant use of vonoprazan, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin leads to an _H. pylori_ eradication rate of approximately 90%.[A253742]

**Indication.** Vonoprazan is indicated for the following conditions: 

- for healing of all grades of erosive esophagitis and relief of heartburn associated with erosive esophagitis in adults.[L51224]
- to maintain healing of all grades of erosive esophagitis and relief of heartburn associated with erosive esophagitis in adults.[L51224]
- for the relief of heartburn associated with non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults.[L51224]
- in combination with [amoxicillin] and [clarithromycin] for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (_H. pylori_) infection in adults.[L41695, L51224]
- in combination with amoxicillin for the treatment of H. pylori infection in adults.[L51224]

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
