## About

**Description.** Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that acts as an inhibitor of several enzymes responsible for the breakdown of complex carbohydrates in the intestines. It inhibits both pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases - including intestinal glucoamylase, sucrase, maltase, and isomaltase - which are responsible for the metabolism of complex starches and oligo-, tri-, and disaccharides into absorbable simple sugars.[L31633,A37868] By inhibiting the activity of these enzymes, acarbose limits the absorption of dietary carbohydrates and the subsequent postprandial increase in blood glucose and insulin levels. Acarbose is therefore used in conjunction with diet, exercise, and other pharmacotherapies for the management of blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.[L31628,L31633]

Acarbose is one of only two approved alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (the other being [miglitol]), receiving its first FDA approval in 1995 under the brand name Precose (since discontinued).[L31668] This class of antidiabetic therapy is not widely used due to their relatively modest impact on A1c, their requirement for thrice-daily dosing, and the potential for significant gastrointestinal adverse effects.[L31668]

**Indication.** Acarbose is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L31628]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
