<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Unknown drives urease inhibition (in µM) (inhibition; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> The sulfaguanidine-containing diclofenac conjugate (11) inhibits urease (measured as % inhibition of urea hydrolysis) with mixed-type inhibition: over 0–20 µM inhibitor and 0.5–4.0 mM urea, Vmax decreases while Km increases, indicating binding to both the active site and an allosteric site. Potency values reported are IC50 = 4.35 ± 0.23 µM (78.7% inhibition) and Ki = 1.09 µM; no kinetic model parameters such as kin, kout, or ke0 are given.
