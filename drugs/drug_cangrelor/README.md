## About

**Description.** Cangrelor is an intravenous, direct-acting, reversible P2Y12 inhibitor for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who have not been yet treated by oral P2Y12 inhibitors. An advantage Cangrelor provides over oral P2Y12 inhibitors (such as prasugrel, ticagrelor, and clopidogrel) is that it is an active drug not requiring metabolic conversion therefore providing a rapid onset and offset of action. Cangrelor was approved by the FDA in June 2015 for intravenous application.

**Indication.** For use as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for reducing the risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI), repeat coronary revascularization, and stent thrombosis (ST) in patients in who have not been treated with a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor and are not being given a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

| popPK | Vargas_2021 | relevant | 8 | 2 | The study reports PK/PD data for cangrelor in neonates, but the evidence provided contains only qualitative descriptions (e.g., "3-fold higher", "undetectable") and lacks specific numeric values for clearance, volume, or half-life. |
| PGx | Wallentin_2009 | not_relevant | 2 | 0 | The text is an abstract of a systematic review that mentions pharmacogenetics as a topic but does not report specific gene variant effects on cangrelor PK/PD parameters. |
| PGx | Wichaiyo_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a general review of antiplatelet drugs and does not report specific pharmacogenomic effects on cangrelor's PK or PD parameters. |
| popPK | Wzorek_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic investigation of cangrelor binding to human serum albumin (reporting KD and thermodynamic parameters) and does not provide pharmacokinetic disposition parameters such as clearance, volume of distribution, or half-life. |
| PD | Wzorek_2021 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The paper focuses on in vitro protein binding interactions (HSA) and does not report a pharmacodynamic exposure-response or dose-response model with numeric PD parameters like Emax or EC50. |
| popPK | Xiao_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a pharmacodynamic cardioprotection experiment in rats where cangrelor is used only as a co-administered comparator agent, and no pharmacokinetic parameters for cangrelor are reported. |
| PD | Xiao_2021 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the cardioprotective efficacy of nicotinamide riboside in the presence of cangrelor, but does not report any pharmacodynamic parameters (e.g., Emax, EC50) or exposure-response relationship for cangrelor itself. |
| PGx | Yousuf_2011 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a general review of antiplatelet therapies and does not report specific pharmacogenomic effects on cangrelor's PK or PD parameters. |
| popPK | Yun_2022 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a clinical safety and efficacy comparison of cangrelor versus eptifibatide for periprocedural bridging and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| popPK | unknown_2015 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The evidence consists only of a conference title with no specific study data, parameters, or mention of cangrelor. |
| PD | unknown_2015 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The provided text is only a header for a conference abstract collection and contains no specific data, models, or parameters for cangrelor. |
