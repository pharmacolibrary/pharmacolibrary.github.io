<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Finerenone (concentrations from the PK model of van_2022) drives estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Finerenone plasma concentrations (µg/L) inhibit estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR-EPI, mL/min/1.73m2) via a power concentration–effect relationship, which the paper states is significantly better than linear, log-linear, or sigmoid Imax models. The paper does not specify the underlying mechanism (e.g., production vs. elimination) or provide specific potency values (IC50, EC50) or rate constants (kin, kout, ke0) for this relationship.
