<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Finerenone (concentrations from the PK model of van_2022) drives serum potassium concentration (in mmol/L): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of serum potassium concentration.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Finerenone plasma concentration (µg/L, from a cited popPK model) drives serum potassium concentration (mmol/L) via a turnover (indirect response) model with a log-linear concentration–effect relationship, predicting an increase in potassium with increasing exposure and attenuation of effect gains at high exposures; the drug effect was proportional to baseline potassium. The paper does not state Imax, IC50/EC50, kin, kout, or ke0 values for this model.
