## About

**Description.** Zavegepant (BHV-3500) is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist.[L45505] CGRP is released from sensory nerves and acts as a strong vasodilator, and thanks to these properties, it is involved in pain pathways. CGRP receptors are expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system; however, CGRP does not cross the blood-brain barrier, suggesting that it acts on peripheral nerves. In migraine, CGRP innervates pain-producing meningeal blood vessels and is released by trigeminal nerve stimulation. Since they inhibit these mechanisms and desensitize neuronal circuits, the use of CGRP receptor antagonists is beneficial in the treatment of migraine.[A258195] 

Small molecule CGRP antagonists are also known as "gepants", and this category includes other drugs such as [rimegepant] and [ubrogepant]. Zavegepant is a third-generation CGRP receptor antagonist that is small in size and highly soluble. Due to its pharmacological properties, it can be administered intranasally.[A258190,A258195] In March 2023, the FDA approved the use of zavegepant nasal spray for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.[L45505,L45510] A clinical trial (NCT04804033) is currently investigating the efficacy and safety of oral zavegepant in migraine prevention, and another one (NCT04987944) is evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral zavegepant (150 mg bid) in subjects with mild allergic asthma.[A258200]

**Indication.** Zavegepant in a nasal spray form is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. It is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine.[L45505]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
