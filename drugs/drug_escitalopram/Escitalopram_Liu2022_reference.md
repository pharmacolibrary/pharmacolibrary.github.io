**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The escitalopram record was held back because the absorption rate constant ka was not reported in the source and a placeholder value was substituted, alongside defaulted Tlag and an assumed F=1 apparent parameterization.**

The model for escitalopram in Chinese psychiatric patients (one-compartment, extravascular dosing with apparent CL/F 14.7 L/h and V/F 581.9 L) relies on a first-order depot input whose ka was invented rather than taken from the paper, and Tlag was likewise left at a placeholder. Bioavailability was assumed to be 1 (F=1, Fm=1) with no molar correction, so all parameters are apparent. A second reader also disagrees on the central estimates, reading CL/F as 16.3 L/h and V/F as 815 L versus 14.7 L/h and 581.9 L, and reports covariate effects (age 0.0077, and effects of 0.847 and 0.479) that this record lacks entirely. Extracted — escitalopram: CL/F 14.7 L/h, V/F 582 L.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[cl/f].value`: this record has 14.7, the second reading 16.3; it also differs on 4 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- kept covariate coefficient θ Age=0.0077 (covariate Age) — not an ontology parameter
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('CL/F', value '0.0877') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q76 ('V/F', value '0.235') — already have one for this compound
- covariate effect for Q49 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- covariate effect for Q47 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=escitalopram
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Friberg_2006's review values (primary lacked it)
