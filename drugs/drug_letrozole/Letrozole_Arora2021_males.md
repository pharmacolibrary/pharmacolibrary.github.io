<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

> **Species: rat.** This record comes from an animal study (rat), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from the LLM relevance screen, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> ℹ️ No reviewer record yet — status shown is the scholar **validate** result; simulation-based reviewer checks have not been run.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="letrozole" model-id="Letrozole_Arora2021_males" status="needs_review" stale="false" population="Sprague-Dawley rats" measured-compound="letrozole" parameterization="mechanistic" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 4 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q19 ('AUC 0–12 (h.ng/ml)', value '2410') — already have one for this compound
- salvaged Q22 ('systemic clearance of letrozole female rats at steady state'=39.3) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=letrozole
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'males' subgroup of Arora_2021 (paper reports 2 populations: females, males)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
