## About

Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections such as rickettsial disease, Bacteroides infections, and outer ear infections. It remains in use, including as a topical treatment for skin, eye, and ear infections, and is listed among WHO essential medicines, though it carries a boxed warning.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
