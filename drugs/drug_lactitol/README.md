## About

**Description.** Lactitol, also known as 4-β-D-galactopyranosyl-D-glucitol, is a sugar alcohol synthesized from [lactose].[A190918] It is used in food manufacturing as a nutritive sweetener and is approximately 35% as sweet as table sugar (i.e. [sucrose]).[A190912] Clinically, lactitol has been investigated for use as an osmotic laxative and, along with other non-absorbable disaccharides such as [lactulose], in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis.[A190915,A190918]

Pizensy, an oral lactitol powder for solution, was approved by the FDA for use in chronic idiopathic constipation in February 2020.[L11803]

**Indication.** Lactitol is indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults.[L11803]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
