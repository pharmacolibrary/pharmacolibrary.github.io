The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | He_2024 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a clinical trial analyzing gingival bleeding outcomes (efficacy) where sodium monofluorophosphate is used only as a negative control, not a pharmacokinetic study. |
| PD | Kamotsay_2002 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The study reports qualitative growth inhibition and lack of bactericidal effect at various concentrations, but does not provide numeric PD parameters (e.g., IC50, Emax) or a fitted dose-response curve. |
| PD | Murray_1996 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The text is a consensus statement/review summarizing clinical outcomes and toxicity profiles without providing specific numeric pharmacodynamic parameters or exposure-response curves. |
| PD | Sebert_1995 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The paper reports a clinical efficacy study comparing two fixed doses (treatment vs placebo) but does not provide concentration-effect data, PK parameters, or a dose-response curve with numeric PD parameters like Emax or EC50. |
| PD | Stösser_1995 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The study reports qualitative dose-response trends (caries scores at 5, 10, 15 ppm) but explicitly states there was no remarkable influence of dosage, and no numeric PD parameters (Emax, EC50, etc.) are provided or derivable. |
| popPK | Vattikonda_1994 | relevant | 9 | 2 | The study reports a two-compartment model for fluoride (the active moiety of sodium monofluorophosphate) in dogs, but specific numeric parameter values (CL, V, etc.) are not present in the provided text. |
| PD | Vattikonda_1994 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on PK and formulation design (bioavailability, release profiles) and does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response data for sodium monofluorophosphate. |
| PD | Vattikonda_1994_2 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on PK (bioavailability, absorption sites) and formulation design, reporting no concentration-effect or dose-response data or PD parameters. |
