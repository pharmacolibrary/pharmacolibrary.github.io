## About

**Description.** Elafibranor is a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and β/δ agonist [A263833] that works to inhibit bile acid synthesis.[L50768] On June 10, 2024, elafibranor was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).[L50773] The drug was also approved by the EMA on September 23, 2024.[L51878]

**Indication.** Elafibranor is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with [ursodeoxycholic acid] (UDCA) in adults who have had an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA.[L50768, L51873] In the US, this indication is approved under accelerated approval and is subject to change based on the determined clinical benefit of the drug in future confirmatory trials.[L50768]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
