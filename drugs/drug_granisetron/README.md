<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Artaiz_1995 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacological effects of VA21B7 in animal models, using granisetron only as a comparator agent without reporting any pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| popPK | Howell_2009 | relevant | 9 | 4 | The paper reports a population PK study for granisetron with some numeric values (Cmax, t1/2, AUC) in the abstract, but specific compartmental parameters (CL, V, Q) are not explicitly listed in the provided text. |
| popPK | Jarvis_2016 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a mechanistic electrophysiology and binding study of 5-HT3 receptor inhibitors, using granisetron only as a fluorescent ligand for competition assays, and reports no pharmacokinetic parameters for granisetron. |
| popPK | Shingaki_2016 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | Granisetron is used as a comparator antiemetic to assess gastrointestinal motility via FDG-PET, not as the subject drug for PK parameter estimation. |
| popPK | Thompson_2024 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin, with granisetron serving only as a co-administered antiemetic comparator rather than the subject drug. |
| PD | Thompson_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports a PK/PD model for cisplatin nephrotoxicity, not for granisetron; granisetron is only mentioned as a covariate (antiemetic type) affecting cisplatin PK parameters. |
| popPK | Thompson_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin (platinum), with granisetron serving only as a co-administered antiemetic comparator rather than the subject drug. |
