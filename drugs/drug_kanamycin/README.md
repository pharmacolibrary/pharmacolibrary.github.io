## About

**Description.** Kanamycin (also known as kanamycin A) is an aminoglycoside bacteriocidal antibiotic, available in oral, intravenous, and intramuscular forms, and used to treat a wide variety of infections. Kanamycin is isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces kanamyceticus and its most commonly used form is kanamycin sulfate.

**Indication.** For treatment of infections where one or more of the following are the known or suspected pathogens: <i>E. coli</i>, <i>Proteus</i> species (both indole-positive and indole-negative), <i>E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens,</i> and <i>Acinetobacter</i> species.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
