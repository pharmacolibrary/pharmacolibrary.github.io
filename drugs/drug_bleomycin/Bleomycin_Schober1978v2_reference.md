<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**Only clearance was extracted — no volume; aUC has no unit.**

A model needs both clearance and volume; without the volume it could only be built on a library default, so it was not. Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. A reported unit could not be converted (fe and AUC), so that value has no SI equivalent. None of the extracted parameters is bleomycin's own; they describe 57Co-Bleomycin. Extracted — 57Co-Bleomycin: Frel 0.5, fe 75 %, AUC 48 Std., CL 0.962 L/min.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on bioavailability: this record has none, the second reading 2; it also differs on 4 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q87 ('Anreicherungsfaktor F', value 2) — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Zeit' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['fig_7:caption', 'fig_7:caption', 'fig_7:caption', 'fig_7:caption'])
- dropped duplicate Q87 ('Restaktivität', value 60) — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Aktivitätsgradient Tumor/Blut' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['fig_7:caption', 'fig_7:caption'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Blutspiegel' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['fig_7:caption', 'fig_7:caption'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'Std.' (AUC)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=57Co-Bleomycin
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- gap-filled Q22 (CL) from Han_2024's review values (primary lacked it)
- gap-filled Q61 (V) from Han_2024's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
