**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The rivaroxaban model was held back because its simulated peak concentration (0.000198) exceeds the paper's reported Cmax (0.00014) by a ratio of 1.4157, and the builder invented an absorption rate constant not reported in the source.**

Simulated as the paper dosed it, the model's Cmax for rivaroxaban is 0.000198 versus the paper's 0.00014, a ratio of 1.4157 beyond tolerance; the check note flags a possible µg/L-to-SI versus kg/m3 unit mismatch. The builder also substituted library defaults for the absorption rate constant (ka) and lag time (Tlag), which are not reported in the source, and assumed F=1 and Fm=1 with no molar correction; this invented absorption was judged not acceptable. A second reader recorded a lag time of 1.22 h where this record has none, so the deviation findings are partly inconclusive. Extracted — rivaroxaban: kabs 0.143, CL/F 7.22 L/h, V/F 4.93 L, D1 0.82 h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of alag1: this record has none, the second reading 1.22. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['ka', 'Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)
- `invented_absorption`: ka defaulted — not reported in source

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ALAG1 (h)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_0:row6:col1', 'tab_0:row6:col2', 'tab_0:row6:col3', 'tab_0:row6:col4', 'tab_0:row6:col5'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=rivaroxaban
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
