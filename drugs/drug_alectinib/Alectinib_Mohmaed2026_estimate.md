<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="alectinib" model-id="Alectinib_Mohmaed2026_estimate" status="rejected" stale="false" population="patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer" measured-compound="2H6-alectinib" parameterization="apparent" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 5 extracted, plus 1 covariate effect.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label (paper)</code></td><td>the row or statistic label exactly as printed in the paper (label_verbatim) — never normalised, so it can be found in the PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Q-code · name</code></td><td>the ontology parameter this label was matched to (Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F, Q49 = ka, Q57 = half-life, …) and its canonical name. The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'MTTfasted (fraction of fed state)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['cpt70141-tbl-0002:row4:col1'])
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Lag time (hours)c' → Q83 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[time]') — route to review
- covariate effect for Q87 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=2H6-alectinib
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'estimate' subgroup of Mohmaed_2026 (paper reports 3 populations: estimate, fasted geometric mean (%cv), fed geometric mean (%cv))
- molar mass: no plausible PubChem entry for '2H6-alectinib' ('2H6-alectinib') — left in mass units
- molar mass: none found for '2H6-alectinib' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell Mohmaed_2026_table_3:row0:col3 = '1.42 (1.16–1.76)'
- unparsed cell Mohmaed_2026_table_3:row1:col3 = '1.52 (1.25–1.89)'
- companion parameter table 3 transcribed (4 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2, 3
