<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**'parameter' is a column of the estimates table, not a study population.**

The table was split into one record per column, and 'parameter' holds a statistic rather than a second set of estimates.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="etirinotecan pegol" model-id="EtirinotecanPegol_Sy2018_parameter" status="rejected" stale="false" population="cancer patients with solid tumors" measured-compound="etirinotecan pegol" parameterization="mechanistic" topology="general_linear"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** general linear; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 3 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label (paper)</code></td><td>the row or statistic label exactly as printed in the paper (label_verbatim) — never normalised, so it can be found in the PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Q-code · name</code></td><td>the ontology parameter this label was matched to (Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F, Q49 = ka, Q57 = half-life, …) and its canonical name. The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'parameter' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Irinotecan' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab4:row12:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'SN38' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab4:row18:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'SN38G' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab4:row26:col1'])
- salvaged Q22 ('CL (L/h)'=0.237) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q63 ('V1 (L)'=5.05) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q64 ('V2∗=V2/F12 (L)'=1.8) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=etirinotecan pegol
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: 4 first-order transfer(s) across 5 compounds → general_linear
- model equation 'θi = θpop∏jcovi,jcovmedian,jkcov,j·exp(ηθ), whereas categorical covariates' not bound — neither LHS nor base term 'θpop' linked to an ontology parameter
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'parameter' subgroup of Sy_2018 (paper reports 2 populations: parameter, population parameter, estimate ± se)
