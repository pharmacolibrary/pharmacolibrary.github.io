## About

**Description.** Hydroxychloroquine is a racemic mixture consisting of an R and S enantiomer.[A183047] Hydroxychloroquine is an aminoquinoline like [chloroquine].[L8072] It is a commonly prescribed medication in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, and systemic lupus erythematosus.[L8072] Hydroxychloroquine is also used for the prophylaxis of malaria in regions where chloroquine resistance is unlikely.[L8072] It was developed during World War II as a derivative of [quinacrine] with less severe side effects.[A183092] Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are both being investigated for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.[A192132]

**The FDA emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and [chloroquine] in the treatment of COVID-19 was revoked on 15 June 2020.[L14312]**

Hydroxychloroquine was granted FDA approval on 18 April 1955.[L8072]

A recent study reported a fatality in the group being treated with hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19.[A192546]

**Indication.** Hydroxychloroquine is indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria where chloroquine resistance is not reported, treatment of uncomplicated malaria (caused by _P. falciparum_, _P. malariae_, _P. ovale_, or _P. vivax_), chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, systemic lupus erythematosus, acute rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic rheumatoid arthritis.[L8072]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
