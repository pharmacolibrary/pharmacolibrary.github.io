<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** HOSU-53 drives dihydroorotate (in unknown): indirect response — drug stimulates the production of dihydroorotate.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> HOSU-53 plasma concentrations inhibit the degradation (Kout) of its substrate dihydroorotate (DHO) in an indirect turnover model (inhibition of loss, since HOSU-53 inhibits DHODH-mediated conversion of DHO to orotate), with IC50 0.1 μmol/L, gamma 1.9, Kout 52 /h, and baseline R0 0.06 μmol/L.
