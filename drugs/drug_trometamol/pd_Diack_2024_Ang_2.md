<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Faricimab (measured concentrations) drives free Ang-2 (in pg/mL): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of free Ang-2.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Faricimab (aqueous humor concentration, µg/mL) inhibits free Ang-2 (pg/mL) in an indirect response model in which faricimab stimulates the loss/elimination of free Ang-2 (kout 4.15 1/day), with EC50 2.59 µg/mL, EMAX 0.987, and Hill coefficients of 1.11 (phase 2) and 0.655 (phase 3).
