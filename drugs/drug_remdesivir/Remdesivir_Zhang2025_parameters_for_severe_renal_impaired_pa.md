**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**This paper's disposition core is incomplete.**

A volume and a clearance/elimination estimate from this paper are needed to build its model. Review values from other papers (Humeniuk_2021) cannot stand in for this paper's evidence. Extracted — remdesivir: Q 0.19 L/h, kic 8.08e+10 1/h, CL 2.99 L/h, V 93 L; intermediate metabolites: Q 12.3 L/h; nucleoside monophosphate: Q 0.038 L/h, CLfm 0.5 L/h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the links between molecules: this record has remdesivir → intermediate metabolites (metabolism); intermediate metabolites → nucleoside monophosphate (metabolism), the second reading remdesivir → intermediate metabolites (im) (metabolism); intermediate metabolites (im) → nucleoside monophosphate (nuc) (metabolism); nucleoside monophosphate (nuc) → gs-443902 (metabolism); it also differs on 9 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- linked 'QRDV' as 'Q' → Q30 (Q) for  — compound marker removed
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'Zhang et al., 2020' (Q)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'Zhang et al., 2020' (CLfm)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'Zhang et al., 2020' (kic)
- dropped duplicate Q370 ('KC,NUC', value '0.85') — already have one for this compound
- linked 'CLC,RDV' as 'CL' → Q22 (CL) for  — compound marker removed
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'Zhang et al., 2020' (CL)
- covariate effect for Q370 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- implicit units: 'QRDV' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'The paper does not state a unit for QRDV. Q represents intercompartmental clearance. In population PK models, intercompa')
- implicit units: 'QIM' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'The paper does not state a unit for QIM. Q represents intercompartmental clearance. In population PK models, intercompar')
- implicit units: 'QNUC' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'The paper does not state a unit for QNUC. Q represents intercompartmental clearance. In population PK models, intercompa')
- implicit units: 'KP,NUC' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'The paper does not state a unit for KP,NUC. KP,NUC is defined as formation clearance (CLfm). Formation clearances are co')
- implicit units: 'KP,NTP' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: "The paper does not state a unit for KP,NTP. The parameter description identifies it as a 'First-order rate constant'. Fi")
- implicit units: 'CLC,RDV' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'The paper does not state a unit for CLC,RDV. CL represents total clearance. In population PK, clearances are conventiona')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=remdesivir
- topology: 2 first-order transfer(s) across 3 compounds → general_linear
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- population split: 'parameters for severe renal-impaired patients (zhang et al., 2020)' subgroup of Zhang_2025 (paper reports 3 populations: parameters for a renal-impaired patient with egfr = 0 (sörgel et al., 2021), parameters for healthy control (zhang et al., 2020), parameters for severe renal-impaired patients (zhang et al., 2020))
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 10/10 row label(s) assigned, 24 linked by role; re-tagged parent→intermediate metabolites ×9, parent→nucleoside monophosphate ×9
- molar mass: no plausible PubChem entry for 'intermediate metabolites' ('Remdesivir Alanine Metabolite (Ala-Met; GS-704277)') — left in mass units
- molar mass: none of 1 PubChem candidate(s) is 'nucleoside monophosphate' (LLM) — left in mass units
- molar mass: none found for 'intermediate metabolites' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- molar mass: none found for 'nucleoside monophosphate' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- gap-filled Q61 (V) from Humeniuk_2021's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell T1:row0:col2 = 'Parameters for healthy control (Zhang et al., 2020)'
- unparsed cell T1:row0:col3 = 'Parameters for severe renal-impaired patients (Zhang et al., 2020)'
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 1
