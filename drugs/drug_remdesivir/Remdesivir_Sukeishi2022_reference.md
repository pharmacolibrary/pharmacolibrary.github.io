<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The paper reports none of the model's key parameters.**

No clearance, volume or rate constant of the model is reported in it. No parameter values were extracted.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has remdesivir, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 6 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `remdesivir`, measured `GS-441524`.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="remdesivir" model-id="Remdesivir_Sukeishi2022_reference" status="rejected" stale="false" population="Japanese adults with COVID-19 and renal dysfunction" measured-compound="GS-441524" parameterization="apparent" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 0 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CLm/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

_No resolved parameters._

### Unresolved rows _(no Q-code or no value — not parameters)_
| label (paper) | Q-code | value | link |
|---|---|---|---|
| CL (L/h) = θ CL × (eGFRnon‐indexed/74.7) θ eGFRnon−idexed,CL | Q351 | not captured | exact |
| V d (L) = θV × (1 + θAge ≥ 75,V × AGE) | Q61 | not captured | exact |

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'IIV for CL' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability, CV%')
- table section iiv: 'IIV for V d' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability, CV%')
- table section residual_error: 'Proportional error' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability, CV%')
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'OBJ' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp412736-tbl-0002:row0:col4', 'psp412736-tbl-0002:row0:col5'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): '1485' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp412736-tbl-0002:row1:col1', 'psp412736-tbl-0002:row1:col2'])
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'CL (L/h) = θ CL × (eGFRnon‐indexed/74.7) θ eGFRnon−idexed,CL' → Q22 (unit '[length] ** 3' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('θ CL (L/h)', value '11.8') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θ eGFRnon‐indexed,CL' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp412736-tbl-0002:row5:col1', 'psp412736-tbl-0002:row5:col2', 'psp412736-tbl-0002:row5:col4', 'psp412736-tbl-0002:row5:col5'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'N = 500' (V1)
- dropped duplicate Q63 ('θV (L)', value '382') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θ Age ≥ 75,V' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['psp412736-tbl-0002:row8:col1', 'psp412736-tbl-0002:row8:col2', 'psp412736-tbl-0002:row8:col4'])
- metabolite gs-441524: Q22→Q351 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- metabolite volume: 'V d (L) = θV × (1 + θAge ≥ 75,V × AGE)' Q63→Q61 for GS-441524 — it is 1-compartment, so its central volume is its only volume
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=GS-441524
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 11/11 row label(s) assigned, 18 linked by role
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures 'GS-441524', not remdesivir — the review values are the parent's

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell psp412736-tbl-0002:row8:col5 = '−0.578–−0.171'
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
