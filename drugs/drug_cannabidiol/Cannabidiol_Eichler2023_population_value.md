> **Species: horse.** This record comes from an animal study (horse), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The cannabidiol horse model was held back because it fails to reproduce the paper's Cmax (1.572842631025892e-06 vs 3.8999999999999997e-07) and terminal half-life (5.165650385265054 h vs 161.29 h), and the absorption rate ka was invented rather than taken from the source.**

Simulated as the paper dosed it, the model's peak concentration exceeds the reported value by a ratio of 4.0329 (1.572842631025892e-06 vs 3.8999999999999997e-07), and the terminal half-life is 5.165650385265054 h against the paper's 161.29 h (ratio 0.032). The absorption rate ka and lag time were not reported in the source, so library defaults were substituted, and the invented absorption was judged not acceptable. The model also assumes F=1 and Fm=1 with no molar correction, using an apparent (/F) parameterization with first-order depot input. Extracted — cannabidiol: CL/F 10.8 L/h/kg, V1/F 77.1 L/kg, Q 1.35 L/h/kg, V2/F 313 L/kg, Q3 38.2 L/h/kg, V3/F 242 L/kg.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['ka', 'Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)
- `invented_absorption`: ka defaulted — not reported in source
- `input_model`: first-order depot input — apparent (/F) parameterization ⇒ extravascular dosing

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Tk0 (h)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab4:row2:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'a' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab4:row10:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'b' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab4:row11:col1'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=cannabidiol
- structure disagreement: deterministic 2C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count
- population split: 'population value' subgroup of Eichler_2023 (paper reports 4 populations: first trial (0.2 mg/kg, n = 3), population value, second trial (1 mg/kg, n = 3), third trial (3 mg/kg, n = 5))

**Extraction notes:**
- companion parameter table 5 transcribed (18 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 4, 5
