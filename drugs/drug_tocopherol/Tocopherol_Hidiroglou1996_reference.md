> **Species: sheep.** This record comes from an animal study (sheep), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The tocopherol record was rejected because the abstract-only source reports no distribution volume and no clearance, and the elimination half-life 42.4 carries the unit /h instead of h, a dimension mismatch on a structural parameter.**

The paper (Hidiroglou_1996, sheep, alpha-tocopherol from dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate) was read at abstract level only, so summary statistics stood in for a fitted model. It reports kabs 0.29 /h, MRT 46 h and AUC 290 micrograms/h per ml, but no volume of distribution and no clearance or elimination rate, so it is an exposure/outcome paper rather than a compartmental population PK model. The terminal elimination half-life is given as 42.4 with unit /h, a dimension mismatch for a half-life that should be in h. A second reader also disputed the dose compound and analyte, the absence of the hydrolysis link from dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate to alpha-tocopherol, and read additional half-lives of 2.46 and 21.20 that this record left null. Extracted — tocopherol: kabs 0.29 /h, t1/2z 42.4 /h, MRT 46 h, AUC 290 micrograms/h per ml.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 7 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-10-05 09:32:33.848441+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 17:01:31.242475+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate`, measured `alpha-tocopherol`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('the second absorption rate constant, Ka2', value 0.03) — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'elimination half-life' → Q57 (unit '1 / [time]' vs ontology '[time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'micrograms/h per ml' (AUC)
- dropped duplicate Q57 ('the second elimination half-life', value 21.2) — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=alpha-tocopherol
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- template fit: none — noncompartmental model — not a compartmental parent–metabolite model
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles (LLM): model_class=noncompartmental; 6/6 row label(s) assigned, 2 linked by role; re-tagged alpha-tocopherol→parent ×7
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Hidiroglou_1996_metadata.yaml (7 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
