<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**No value for pemetrexed's volume of distribution.**

The model was built, but pemetrexed's volume of distribution had no value, so a library placeholder stood in and the model was held back rather than published with an invented number. Extracted — pemetrexed: CLNR 0.79 L/h, CL 4.1 L/h.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `model_quarantined` (reviewed 2026-09-28 14:39:24.317266+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 17:11:53.752637+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="pemetrexed" model-id="Pemetrexed_de2022_reference" status="rejected" stale="true" population="adults with lung cancer" measured-compound="pemetrexed" parameterization="mechanistic" topology="1C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 0 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

_No resolved parameters._

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section covariance: 'IIVV1,V2' routed out of structural estimates ('Correlation (%)')
- table section covariance: 'IIVV1,V3' routed out of structural estimates ('Correlation (%)')
- table section covariance: 'IIVV2,V3' routed out of structural estimates ('Correlation (%)')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=pemetrexed
- review gap-fill skipped: this record carries no value of its own, and a model assembled entirely from other papers is not this paper's model

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) S1

## Validation

**Scholar closed-form checks:**

| check | status | expected | obtained | ratio | tol | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C0_has_structural_params | fail | not captured | 0 | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C0b_disposition_core | fail | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C8_topology | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |

**Reviewer per-scenario checks:**

| check | scenario | status | expected | obtained | ratio | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T0_analyte_identity | not captured | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | V/CL labels are the drug's (or a metabolite's), no biomarker signal |
| T2_covariates | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no covariate effects in record |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | pass | 2 scholar param(s) emitted or defaulted | 2 covered | not captured | all structural parameters accounted for |
| T3_topology_template | not captured | pass | 1C → PK_1C* | PK_1C | not captured | engineer template must match the scholar topology |
| T6_deviations | not captured | pass | not captured | all deviations documented+quantified | not captured | LLM adjudication → deterministic rule |

<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>check</code></td><td>the check id. C0_has_structural_params = at least one numeric structural parameter; C0b_disposition_core = a volume OR a clearance/elimination term (neither means an exposure/outcome paper, not popPK — rejected); C0c_disposition_complete = BOTH a volume AND a clearance/elimination term, which is what the engineer needs to build (one without the other routes to review, never to the engineer); C1_half_life(_beta) = reported half-life against V and CL; C2_reference = covariate scenarios are sign-plausible; C3_cl_dose_auc = CL against dose/AUC; C4_auc_closed_form = AUC recomputed in closed form; C5_dimension_&lt;Qcode&gt; = the parameter's units carry the dimension its Q-code requires.</td></tr><tr><td><code>status</code></td><td>pass, fail, or skipped. A skipped check had nothing to compare — the paper did not report the input it needs — and is not evidence against the record. The scholar table lists only pass and fail; the reviewer table also shows skipped, with the reason in note.</td></tr><tr><td><code>expected</code></td><td>the value the check required, from the paper or from the ontology.</td></tr><tr><td><code>obtained</code></td><td>what the record actually yields.</td></tr><tr><td><code>ratio</code></td><td>obtained / expected, where the check is a numeric comparison.</td></tr><tr><td><code>tol</code></td><td>the tolerance the ratio had to fall within to pass.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>the artifact the expected value was taken from.</td></tr><tr><td><code>scenario</code></td><td>reviewer table only — the covariate scenario the check was run under.</td></tr><tr><td><code>note</code></td><td>why a check was skipped, or how it was judged.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>
