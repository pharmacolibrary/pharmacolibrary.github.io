A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

| PGx | Szlosarek_2021 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study evaluates the efficacy and safety of a drug combination in patients selected by a tumor biomarker (ASS1 deficiency) but does not report how a gene variant alters the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of pemetrexed. |
| PGx | Takeda_2023 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study reports associations between SNPs and clinical outcomes (toxicity/efficacy) but does not report pharmacokinetic (PK) or pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters. |
| PGx | Vallo_2015 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates drug resistance in cell lines and does not report pharmacogenomic effects on PK or PD parameters for pemetrexed. |
| PGx | Visser_2021 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study explicitly reports that no significant associations were observed between the investigated SNPs and pemetrexed clearance (PK), and the reported PD effects are on clinical outcomes (survival/toxicity) rather than direct pharmacodynamic parameters. |
| PGx | Vázquez_2019 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study reports no significant association between MTHFR/TYMS genotypes and toxicity or survival, and does not report changes in PK/PD parameters. |
| PGx | Walia_2022 | not_relevant | 2 | 5 | The paper reports associations between MTHFR polymorphisms and clinical toxicity endpoints (diarrhea, neutropenia) and survival, but does not report changes in specific pharmacokinetic (PK) or pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of pemetrexed. |
| PGx | Xu_2019 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates acquired drug resistance in cell lines via gene expression changes (ABCB1, TYMS), not the effect of a specific germline gene variant on PK/PD parameters. |
| popPK | Yang_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of osimertinib and its metabolite AZ5104, with pemetrexed serving only as a co-administered chemotherapy agent without reported PK parameters. |
| PD | Yang_2025 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The paper analyzes the exposure-response relationship for osimertinib (finding no significant link to PFS) and notes that pemetrexed cycles are associated with PFS, but it does not report a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic model for pemetrexed, nor does it provide numeric PD parameters (e.g., Emax, EC50) for pemetrexed. |
| PGx | Zhong_2014 | not_relevant | 2 | 5 | The paper reports an association between BIM deletion and progression-free survival (clinical outcome) for pemetrexed, but does not report changes in specific pharmacokinetic (PK) or pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters (e.g., AUC, Cmax, receptor occupancy). |
