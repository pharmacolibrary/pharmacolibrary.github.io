<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Pemetrexed, osimertinib drive Bim levels (in unknown): delayed effect through transit (transduction) compartments.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Osimertinib concentration inhibits EGFR signaling; the deviation of EGFR from baseline (1−EGFR) is used as a surrogate for Bim levels, which are upregulated proportionally to EGFR inhibition, and Bim/1−EGFR drives the apoptotic signal (CL-PARP) via a power-law with exponent γbim (Bim-deleted genotype simulated with kbim = 21.1 and a fivefold-increased γbim). The paper does not state numeric values for EC50,osi, Imax,osi, or γbim, and no direct pemetrexed effect on Bim is described.

## Models

<p>No downloads: this record is <b>rejected</b>, so it is not published as a model. Any archives generated for it before the verdict have been removed — a download outlives the page that explains it.</p>

<div class="pk-tab-mark" data-tab="Simulation"></div>

_No web simulator for this record: its structure has no shared WebAssembly template. The FMI archive under **Models** carries its own compiled FMU._
