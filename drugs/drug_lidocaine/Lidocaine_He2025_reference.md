A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The lidocaine model was rejected because the metabolite GX has no path from the administered dose: the lidocaine→MEGX→GX metabolic chain is incomplete, and the lidocaine clearance value of 26.1 L/h is disputed.**

The structure links lidocaine to MEGX and MEGX to GX via metabolism, but the GX metabolite is unlinked, leaving part of the model unreachable from the dose. The only extracted parameter is lidocaine total clearance, 26.1 L/h, which a second reader recorded as null rather than 26.1. No other parameter values were available to support the record. Extracted — lidocaine: CL 26.1 L/h.

Independently confirmed by `gpt-oss:120b`.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-10-05 09:27:22.066529+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-06 03:22:49.307848+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

- salvaged Q22 ('lidocaine clearance estimated by the final model'=26.1) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=lidocaine
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
