> **Species: rat.** This record comes from an animal study (rat), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The lidocaine record was rejected because it reports no distribution volume and no clearance or elimination rate — an exposure/outcome paper, not a compartmental population PK model — and the metabolite GX is unreachable from the dose.**

The record for lidocaine in male Sprague-Dawley rats contains only summary exposure statistics for the metabolite GX (terminal half-life 61.78 h, Cmax 0.33 ng/mL, Tmax 1786.53 h), with no volume or clearance parameters, so it is not a compartmental population PK model. The GX metabolite has no path from the administered lidocaine dose, leaving it orphaned. Additionally, a reported unit could not be converted to SI, so that parameter lacked an SI value. A second reader disputed the parameterization (apparent rather than mechanistic) and read several parameters (cld/f 0.13, clm1/f 14.94, fm1 0.65, fr 0.373, ka1 5.92, km 136808.67, mtt 0.64) where the record had none. Extracted — GX: t1/2z 61.8 h, Cmax 0.33 ng/mL, tmax 1.79e+03 h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has lidocaine, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 19 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Compound' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Kim_2021_table_3:row0:col3', 'Kim_2021_table_3:row0:col6', 'Kim_2021_table_3:row0:col9', 'Kim_2021_table_3:row0:col12', 'Kim_2021_table_3:row0:col15'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=lidocaine
- topology: 2 first-order transfer(s) across 3 compounds → general_linear
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- population split: 'gx' subgroup of Kim_2021 (paper reports 12 populations: (0.3% solution, iv), (0.3% solution, sc), (lha 0.3%, sc), (lha 1%, sc), (lha 3%, sc), estimate, group 1, group 2, group 3, group 4, group 5, gx)
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 28/28 row label(s) assigned, 18 linked by role; re-tagged parent→monoethylglycylxylidide ×6, parent→glycylxylidide ×4
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
