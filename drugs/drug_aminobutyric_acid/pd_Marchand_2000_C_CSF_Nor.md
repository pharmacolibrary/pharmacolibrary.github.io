<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Noroxacin drives noroxacin CSF concentration at onset of maximal seizures (in unknown): direct Emax (saturable) effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> An inhibitory Emax model with a baseline parameter was fitted to CSF norfloxacin concentration at onset of maximal seizures versus CSF BPAA concentration: BPAA reduces the norfloxacin concentration needed for seizures, with baseline C_CSF0,Nor = 47.3 ± 2.3 µM, an asymptotic value C_CSF,base,Nor at infinite BPAA, and a CSF50,BPAA defined as the BPAA concentration halving the difference between baseline and asymptote; no Imax, gamma, kin/kout or ke0 values are given, and the paper does not state a mechanistic production/elimination link beyond this direct inhibitory Emax relationship.

## Models

<p>No downloads: this record is <b>rejected</b>, so it is not published as a model. Any archives generated for it before the verdict have been removed — a download outlives the page that explains it.</p>

<div class="pk-tab-mark" data-tab="Simulation"></div>

_No web simulator for this record: its structure has no shared WebAssembly template. The FMI archive under **Models** carries its own compiled FMU._
