## About

Cholic acid, a naturally occurring bile acid, is used to treat certain inborn errors of metabolism, including peroxisomal disorders. It is authorised in the European Union as a bile therapy medicine, though one related product has been withdrawn.

The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Hofmann_1983 | relevant | 10 | 2 | The paper presents a detailed physiological compartmental model for cholic acid in humans, but the specific numeric parameter values (transfer coefficients, clearances) are largely described in the text or referenced to figures/tables not fully provided in the evidence snippet. |
| popPK | Molino_1986 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study focuses on chenodeoxycholic acid (CDC) and only mentions cholic acid as a previous model or comparator, with no quantitative PK parameters for cholic acid provided in the evidence. |
| popPK | Strange_1979 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study reports subcellular partition coefficients and distribution percentages in rat liver, not systemic pharmacokinetic parameters like clearance, volume of distribution, or half-life. |
| popPK | Varma_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an observational epidemiological and metabolomic analysis of bile acid concentrations in relation to dementia, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting disposition parameters like clearance or volume. |
| popPK | Zhou_2018 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study measures fecal concentrations of cholic acid as a metabolite marker in a toxicology study, not pharmacokinetic disposition parameters (CL, V, ka) for cholic acid as a subject drug. |
