<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Carucci_2023 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a malaria transmission-blocking screening study where cymarin is only listed as a compound in a library (Table S1) with in-vitro IC50 values, and no pharmacokinetic parameters for cymarin are reported. |
| PGx | Gozalpour_2013 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the binding affinity of cymarin to P-glycoprotein mutants in vitro, which is a mechanistic study of transporter interaction, not a report of a pharmacogenomic effect on a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameter in a clinical or physiological context. |
| popPK | Gozalpour_2014 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on convallatoxin as a P-gp substrate, not cymarin, and does not report pharmacokinetic parameters for cymarin. |
| PGx | Gozalpour_2014 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies convallatoxin, not cymarin, and focuses on transporter interactions rather than pharmacogenomic effects on cymarin PK/PD. |
| popPK | Hori_1988 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a mechanistic study on ion efflux in guinea-pig smooth muscle where cymarin is used as a pharmacological inhibitor, not a pharmacokinetic study. |
| PD | Hori_1988 | not_relevant | 1 | 1 | The paper reports a single qualitative inhibition of palytoxin-induced K+ efflux by cymarin at a fixed concentration (3 x 10^-8 M) without providing a dose-response curve or numeric PD parameters (e.g., IC50, Emax) for cymarin. |
| popPK | Ozaki_1985 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a mechanistic in-vitro investigation of palytoxin and cardiac glycosides on ATPase, not a pharmacokinetic study of cymarin. |
| popPK | Shang_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the acaricidal mechanism and active compounds of a plant extract, with cymarin serving only as a mechanistic target ligand, and contains no pharmacokinetic data. |
| PGx | Tzeng_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates cymarin as a therapeutic agent targeting ANT2 in breast cancer, but does not report any pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants altering PK/PD) of cymarin. |
| popPK | van_2018 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic investigation of PPARα transactivation and gene expression, containing no pharmacokinetic parameters for cymarin. |
