<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** TD-6450 (measured concentrations) drives name (in retention rate) (inhibition; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> The paper does not describe a pharmacodynamic model for TD-6450; it reports dose-response (log agonist vs response, variable slope) curves for gametocyte killing and stiffening (retention rate) with IC50 values, but no IC50, Emax, kin, kout or ke0 values are given for TD-6450 itself (only a chemical analog with IC50 of 2.44 µM for killing and 0.8 µM for retention). The mechanism of TD-6450-induced mature gametocyte stiffening is not stated beyond its identification as an NS5A inhibitor.
