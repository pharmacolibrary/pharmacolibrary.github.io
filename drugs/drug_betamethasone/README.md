## About

**Description.** Betamethasone is a long-acting corticosteroid with immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory properties.[A192444] It can be used topically to manage inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema, and parenterally to manage several disease states including autoimmune disorders.[A192444] Betamethasone has potent glucocorticoid activity and negligible mineralocorticoid activity.[A192444]

**Indication.** As a member of the corticosteroid family, betamethasone is indicated for the treatment of several inflammatory conditions. As topical monotherapy, betamethasone is indicated to relieve pruritic and inflammatory symptoms of corticosteroid-responsive-dermatoses.[L11991,L10782,L11997] Betamethasone can be used topically in combination with a vitamin D analog such as calcipotriene to treat plaque psoriasis.[L12000] The corticosteroid is also available as an injectable suspension and can be used to manage a range of inflammatory conditions including endocrine disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and rheumatic disorders among other conditions.[L11994]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
