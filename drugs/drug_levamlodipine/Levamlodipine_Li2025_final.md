<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
</details>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**Bioavailability and lag time were left at library defaults, and clearance and volume values conflict with a second reader's extraction.**

The record lacks explicit estimates for bioavailability and lag time, relying instead on placeholder values that affect the simulated profile. A second reader disagreed on the primary analyte identity and extracted different values for clearance (58.71 L/h) and volume (3410 L) than the recorded 59.61 L/h and 3572 L. Extracted — levamlodipine: kabs 0.79 1/h, V 3.57e+03 L, CL 59.6 L/h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which molecule was measured: this record has levamlodipine besylate, the second reading levamlodipine; it also differs on 2 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['F', 'Tlag']

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped PD-category row 'tvIC50' → Q322 (IC50, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['t0006:row5:col1', 't0006:row5:col2', 't0006:row5:col3'])
- dropped PD-category row 'tvE0' → Q324 (E0, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['t0006:row6:col1', 't0006:row6:col2', 't0006:row6:col3'])
- dropped PD-category row 'tvImax' → Q323 (Imax, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['t0006:row7:col1', 't0006:row7:col2', 't0006:row7:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'dCldUA' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['t0006:row8:col1', 't0006:row8:col2', 't0006:row8:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'dCldeGFR' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['t0006:row9:col1', 't0006:row9:col2', 't0006:row9:col3'])
- routed 'stdev0' → Q315 (sigma) to residual_error — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Covariate model' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Li_2025_table_5:row0:col2'])
- implicit units: 'tvKa' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'The parameter tvKa is the absorption rate constant. In population pharmacokinetic modeling, first-order rate constants a')
- implicit units: 'tvV' → L (from the paper text: "The paper text states: 'Typical values of the model with the inclusion of covariates were altered compared to the base m")
- implicit units: 'tvCl' → L/h (from the paper text: "The paper text states: 'Typical values of the model with the inclusion of covariates were altered compared to the base m")
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q61 (tvV); Q22 (tvCl)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=levamlodipine besylate
- model-stage split: 'final' is the final model of Li_2025 (paper reports 2 stages: base, final); same population, different model-building step

**Extraction notes:**

- unparsed cell t0006:row9:col4 = '0.64 ~ 1.21'
- unparsed cell t0006:row10:col4 = '0.04 ~ 0.07'
- unparsed cell Li_2025_table_4:row0:col3 = 'h−1'
- unparsed cell Li_2025_table_4:row2:col2 = 'L·h−1'
- companion parameter table 4 transcribed (6 record(s), model stage 'base')
- unparsed cell Li_2025_table_5:row0:col3 = '·h−1'
- companion parameter table 5 transcribed (1 record(s), model stage 'final')
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 4, 5
- dropped sensitivity-analysis table(s) 6 from the LLM selection — perturbations of a model, not a model
