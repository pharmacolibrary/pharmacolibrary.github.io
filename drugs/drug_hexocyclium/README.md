## About

**Description.** Hexocyclium is a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist which was presumably used in the treatment of gastric ulcer or diarrhea. It was once available under the tradename Tral marketed by Abbvie Inc. but has been discontinued. Proton pump inhibitors like [DB00338] and opiate anti-diarrheal agents like [DB00836] have largely replaced the use of anti-muscarinics in the treatment of gastric ulcers and diarrhea due to their more favorable side effect profiles.

**Indication.** The World Health Organization classifies hexocyclium as a drug for functional gastrointestinal disorders [L876]. Like other anti-muscarinic agents, hexocyclium was likely used to treat peptic ulcers or diarrhea.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
