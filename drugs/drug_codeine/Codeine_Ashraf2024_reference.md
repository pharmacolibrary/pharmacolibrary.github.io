A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was generated (see the **Models** tab); it has no in-browser simulator.

### Reviewer guidance

**The codeine model record was held back because two of its nine parameters, the absorption rate constant kabs (6.49 1/h) and the central volume V1 (231.2 L), were not carried into the model, leaving only 7 of 9 parameters covered.**

The coverage check expected 9 parameters emitted or defaulted but obtained 7, with kabs and V1 neither emitted nor defaulted, so the codeine absorption and distribution description would be incomplete. A second reader also disagreed on several entries: it read the codeine clearance as 59.6 L/h where the record had null, read a codeine fraction of 0.4556 where the record had null, and proposed an additional metabolism link from codeine-6-glucuronide to morphine-3-glucuronide that the record does not contain; the record's values 6.49, 59.6 and 231.2 were read as null by that reader. The disagreement on dose compound and primary analyte (codeine vs unknown) remains unresolved. Extracted — codeine: kabs 6.49 1/h, CL 59.6 L/h, V1 231 L; morphine: CL 178 L/h, V 9.45 L, fm 0.108; codeine-6-glucuronide: CL 4.28 L/h, V 5.36 L; morphine-3-glucuronide: CL 4.67 L/h, V 4.17 L.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has codeine, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 10 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

- metabolite volume: 'Vc,M3G' Q63→Q61 for morphine-3-glucuronide — it is 1-compartment, so its central volume is its only volume
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q22 (CLcod); Q63 (Vc,cod); Q22 (CLmor); Q61 (Vc,mor); Q22 (CLC6G); Q61 (Vc,C6G); Q22 (CLM3G); Q61 (Vc,M3G)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=codeine

- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

<summary>Check legend — what each column means</summary>
<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>check</code></td><td>the check id. C0_has_structural_params = at least one numeric structural parameter; C0b_disposition_core = a volume OR a clearance/elimination term (neither means an exposure/outcome paper, not popPK — rejected); C0c_disposition_complete = BOTH a volume AND a clearance/elimination term, which is what the engineer needs to build (one without the other routes to review, never to the engineer); C1_half_life(_beta) = reported half-life against V and CL; C2_reference = covariate scenarios are sign-plausible; C3_cl_dose_auc = CL against dose/AUC; C4_auc_closed_form = AUC recomputed in closed form; C5_dimension_&lt;Qcode&gt; = the parameter's units carry the dimension its Q-code requires.</td></tr><tr><td><code>status</code></td><td>pass, fail, or skipped. A skipped check had nothing to compare — the paper did not report the input it needs — and is not evidence against the record. The scholar table lists only pass and fail; the reviewer table also shows skipped, with the reason in note.</td></tr><tr><td><code>expected</code></td><td>the value the check required, from the paper or from the ontology.</td></tr><tr><td><code>obtained</code></td><td>what the record actually yields.</td></tr><tr><td><code>ratio</code></td><td>obtained / expected, where the check is a numeric comparison.</td></tr><tr><td><code>tol</code></td><td>the tolerance the ratio had to fall within to pass.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>the artifact the expected value was taken from.</td></tr><tr><td><code>scenario</code></td><td>reviewer table only — the covariate scenario the check was run under.</td></tr><tr><td><code>note</code></td><td>why a check was skipped, or how it was judged.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>
