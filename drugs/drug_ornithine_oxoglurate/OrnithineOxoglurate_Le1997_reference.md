A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The ornithine oxoglurate record was rejected because its metabolism links leave metabolites (proline, glutamine, arginine) unreachable from the dose, and it was built from the abstract only, so summary statistics stand in for a fitted model.**

The structure check found unreachable compartments or unlinked metabolites in the linear model linking ornithine oxoglurate to ornithine, proline, glutamine and arginine, with no link parameters extracted. The record is abstract-only, so the reported values (absorption constant 0.028 min-1, terminal half-life 89 min, clearance 26.0 mL/min, volume of distribution 33.2 L for ornithine) are summary statistics rather than fitted model parameters. A second reader also disagreed on the dose compound name (ornithine_alpha_ketoglutarate) and read no values for the four parameters. Extracted — ornithine oxoglurate: kabs 0.028 min-1, t1/2z 89 min, CL 26 mL/min, V 33.2 L.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has ornithine_oxoglurate, the second reading ornithine_alpha_ketoglutarate; it also differs on 5 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by glm-5.3-flash</sub>

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `ornithine_oxoglurate`, measured `ornithine`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'proline' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Le_1997:abstract'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'glutamine' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Le_1997:abstract'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'arginine' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Le_1997:abstract'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=ornithine
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- gap-filled Q22 (CL) from Wang_2022's review values (primary lacked it)
- gap-filled Q61 (V) from Wang_2022's review values (primary lacked it)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is GENERAL_LINEAR (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Le_1997_metadata.yaml (5 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
