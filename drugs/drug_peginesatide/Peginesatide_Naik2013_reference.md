A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The peginesatide record lacks any clearance parameter — only volumes (V2 35.6 mL/kg, V3 7.42 mL/kg, V 34.9 mL/kg) and Q 5.23 mL/kg/hr were extracted — so the disposition is incomplete and the model was held back.**

Only volume terms were extracted for peginesatide; no clearance was recorded, so a model would have needed a library default for the missing clearance and was therefore not built. A reference check also failed without computing a comparison (ratio None), so it is inconclusive rather than a demonstrated fault. A second reader further disagreed on covariate forms, reading the BMI effect on Q (-0.485) as a BMI power on the central volume instead, and did not confirm the mean volume of 34.9 mL/kg. Extracted — peginesatide: Vmax 44.7, Km 1.86e+03, V2 35.6, kabs 0.00869, Fab 0.499 F1, Q 5.23, V3 7.42, V 34.9 mL/kg.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the links between molecules: this record has none, the second reading peginesatide → hemoglobin (pharmacodynamic_stimulation); it also differs on 3 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- routed 'Cov between V2 and Ka' → Q314 (omega_cov) to covariance — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- covariate effect for Q319 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- covariate effect for Q335 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- implicit units: 'Maximum rate of elimination (Vmax), in ng/mL/hr' — the LLM proposed 'ng/mL/hr', whose dimension does not fit Q66; left unset
- implicit units: 'Concentration needed to reach 50% of Vmax (KM),in ng/mL' → ng/mL (from the paper text: "The parameter list explicitly states: 'Concentration needed to reach 50% of Vmax (KM),in ng/mL = 1860'")
- implicit units: 'Central volume of distribution (V2), in mL/kg' → mL/kg (from the paper text: "The parameter list explicitly states: 'Central volume of distribution (V2), in mL/kg = 35.6'")
- implicit units: 'Absorption rate constant (Ka), in 1/hr' → 1/hr (from the paper text: "The parameter list explicitly states: 'Absorption rate constant (Ka), in 1/hr = 0.00869'")
- implicit units: 'Inter–compartmental clearance (Q), in mL/kg/hr' → mL/kg/hr (from the paper text: "The parameter list explicitly states: 'Inter–compartmental clearance (Q), in mL/kg/hr = 5.23'")
- implicit units: 'Peripheral volume of distribution (V3), in mL/kg' → mL/kg (from the paper text: "The parameter list explicitly states: 'Peripheral volume of distribution (V3), in mL/kg = 7.42'")
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=peginesatide
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- molar mass: none found for 'peginesatide' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
