The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Ishikawa_1993 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical case report on the treatment of organophosphorus intoxication and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters for prifinium bromide. |
| PD | Ishikawa_1993 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The text is a qualitative clinical summary describing the efficacy of prifinium bromide in treating chronic organophosphorus intoxication but provides no numeric PD parameters, dose-response data, or concentration-effect analysis. |

| PD | Ishikawa_1996 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an epidemiological and pathological study of organophosphorus pesticide toxicity; prifinium bromide is only mentioned as a treatment antidote without any pharmacodynamic modeling, dose-response analysis, or numeric PD parameters. |
| popPK | Kubo_1981 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a pharmacological investigation of ganglion blocking activity in animals, and prifinium bromide is used only as a comparator agent with no pharmacokinetic parameters reported. |
| PD | Kubo_1981 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper focuses on the pharmacological profile of HSR-902, mentioning prifinium bromide only for qualitative potency ranking without providing numeric PD parameters or concentration-effect data for it. |
