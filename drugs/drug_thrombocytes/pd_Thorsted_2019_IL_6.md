<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Endotoxin drives interleukin-6 (in ng/L): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of interleukin-6.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Plasma IL-6 (ng/L) is driven by endotoxin (ETX) via an indirect response model in which both the relative increase in TNF-α and the ETX time-course linearly stimulate IL-6 production, with four transit compartments delaying the IL-6 rise (MTT 6.33 h, RSE%); the estimated IL-6 baseline was 8.19 ng/L, and linear effect models were preferred over Emax/sigmoidal Emax for both stimuli. The upstream ETX–TNF-α relation was nonlinear with Vmax 442000, KM 12600, Emax 2540, γ 2.10, and tolerance TC50 29300 with Tmax 45100 (units as reported).
