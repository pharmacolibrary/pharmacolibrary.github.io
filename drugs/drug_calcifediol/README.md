## About

**Description.** The major circulating metabolite of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). It is produced in the liver and is the best indicator of the body's vitamin D stores. It is effective in the treatment of rickets and osteomalacia, both in azotemic and non-azotemic patients. Calcifediol also has mineralizing properties.

**Indication.** Used to treat vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, refractory rickets (vitamin D resistant rickets), familial hypophosphatemia and hypoparathyroidism, and in the management of hypocalcemia and renal osteodystrophy in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis. Also used in conjunction with calcium in the management and prevention of primary or corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| popPK | Zhang_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a systematic review of population pharmacokinetics for imipenem, not calcifediol. |
| PD | Zhang_2025 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a systematic review of population pharmacokinetic (PK) models for imipenem and does not report any pharmacodynamic (PD) or exposure-response relationships for calcifediol or any other drug. |
| popPK | Zheng_2018 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic investigation of VDR signaling where calcifediol is used only as a VDR inhibitor, with no pharmacokinetic parameters reported. |
| PD | Zheng_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports IC50 values for tamoxifen, not for calcifediol, and calcifediol is only mentioned qualitatively as a VDR inhibitor used to reverse effects, with no exposure-response or dose-response data provided for it. |
| popPK | van_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a systematic review of population pharmacokinetics for immunoglobulins (IVIg/SCIg), not calcifediol. |
| PD | van_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a systematic review of pharmacokinetic models for immunoglobulins (IVIg/SCIg) and does not contain any data, analysis, or parameters for calcifediol. |
