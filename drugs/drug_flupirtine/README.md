## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

| PD | Roberts_2016 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is a QSP modeling study that qualitatively predicts the lack of clinical benefit for flupirtine but does not report specific numeric PD parameters (e.g., Emax, EC50) or an extractable concentration-effect curve for the drug. |
| popPK | Sato_2022 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro electrophysiology study of XE991 in rat neurons, using flupirtine only as a probe agent without reporting any pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| PD | Sato_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on XE991 and only qualitatively mentions flupirtine without providing numeric PD parameters or a concentration-effect curve for it. |
| PGx | Scheuch_2015 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports the development and validation of an LC-MS/MS method to quantify flupirtine and its metabolites, not the pharmacogenomic results themselves. |
| PD | So_2014 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the electrophysiological effects of midazolam, not flupirtine. |
| popPK | So_2019 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an electrophysiology study on ion channels where flupirtine is used only as a pharmacological tool to modulate currents, not as a subject for pharmacokinetic analysis. |
| PD | So_2019 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports pharmacological effects of bisoprolol on potassium currents, with flupirtine used only as a control agent; it does not report a PD or exposure-response relationship for flupirtine. |
| popPK | Surur_2019 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a medicinal chemistry study on ligand-based drug design for KV7.2/3 activators, not a pharmacokinetic study, and contains no disposition parameters for flupirtine. |
| PD | Surur_2019 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a ligand-based drug design study reporting in vitro potency (EC50) for new analogs, not a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic exposure-response analysis for flupirtine. |
| popPK | Tu_2015 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a neurophysiological study of retinal oscillations in mice where flupirtine is used only as a pharmacological tool to block M-type potassium channels, not as a subject of pharmacokinetic analysis. |
| PD | Tu_2015 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The paper uses flupirtine as a pharmacological tool to characterize retinal oscillation mechanisms, reporting only qualitative effects (inhibition of ON-SAC oscillation) without providing a dose-response curve, Emax, EC50, or any quantitative PD parameters. |
| popPK | Wu_2014 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro pharmacodynamic analysis of K+ channel openers in neuronal networks and does not report pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, t1/2, etc.) for flupirtine. |
| popPK | Wurm_2023 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a medicinal chemistry study on the synthesis and in-vitro activity of nicotinamide analogs as new K_V7 channel openers, using flupirtine only as a structural reference for adverse liability, and contains no pharmacokinetic data. |
| popPK | de_2015 | relevant | 4 | 0 | The paper reports population PK ratios for flupirtine in humans but does not provide absolute quantitative parameters (like CL, V, ka) in the extracted evidence. |
