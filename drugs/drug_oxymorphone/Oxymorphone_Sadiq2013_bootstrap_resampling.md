<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**Rejected because oxymorphone's clearance (47.8 mL/min) and volume of distribution (14.1 mL) fall outside the physiological window for male Sprague-Dawley rats, suggesting a unit or scale extraction error.**

The record lists total clearance of 47.8 mL/min, central volume of 14.1 mL, and intercompartmental clearance of 53.8 mL/min for oxymorphone in rats. The review judged the clearance and volume magnitudes physiologically implausible for this species, consistent with a unit or scale error during extraction. The intercompartmental clearance exceeding total clearance (53.8 vs 47.8 mL/min) further reflects the implausible parameter magnitudes. Extracted — oxymorphone: CL 47.8 mL/min, V 14.1 mL, Q 53.8 mL/min, fu 11.9.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'bootstrap resampling' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped duplicate Q30 ('Q av (mL/min)', value '39.4') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'REC blood (%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row7:col2', 'tab_1:row7:col3', 'tab_1:row7:col4'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'REC brain (%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row8:col2', 'tab_1:row8:col3', 'tab_1:row8:col4'])
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('CL in (mL/min)', value '10.5') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'K p,uu' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row10:col2', 'tab_1:row10:col4'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Baseline effect (s)' → Q324 (E0, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['tab_1:row11:col2', 'tab_1:row11:col4'])
- dropped PD-category row 'E max (s)' → Q320 (Emax, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['tab_1:row12:col4'])
- dropped PD-category row 'EC 50 (ng/mL)' → Q321 (EC50, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['tab_1:row13:col3', 'tab_1:row13:col4'])
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('ω CL', value '34') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q63 ('ω Vc', value '58.5') — already have one for this compound
- routed 'ω fu' → Q314 (omega_cov) to covariance — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- routed 'ω Base' → Q314 (omega_cov) to covariance — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- dropped PD-category row 'ω EC50' → Q321 (EC50, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['tab_1:row19:col2', 'tab_1:row19:col4'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=oxymorphone
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- 1C volume normalization: Q63→Q61 (single-compartment model has no central/peripheral split; 'V c (mL)' is the general volume)
- population split: 'bootstrap resampling' subgroup of Sadiq_2013 (paper reports 2 populations: bootstrap resampling, original data set)
