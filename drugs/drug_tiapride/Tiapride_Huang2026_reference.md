<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model structure:** 1-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 6 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Parameter' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['t0003:row0:col4', 't0003:row0:col5', 't0003:row0:col6'])
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'θVmax (mg/h)' → Q66 (unit '[mass] / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θK30 (h−1)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['t0003:row4:col1', 't0003:row4:col2', 't0003:row4:col4', 't0003:row4:col5', 't0003:row4:col6'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ηK30 (%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['t0003:row6:col1', 't0003:row6:col2', 't0003:row6:col3', 't0003:row6:col4', 't0003:row6:col5', 't0003:row6:col6'])
- routed 'εprop (%)' → Q316 (prop_error) to residual_error — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θFFM-CL/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Huang_2026_table_2:row4:col1', 'Huang_2026_table_2:row4:col2', 'Huang_2026_table_2:row4:col4', 'Huang_2026_table_2:row4:col5', 'Huang_2026_table_2:row4:col6'])
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('ηKa (%)', value '17.6') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('ηCL/F (%)', value '22.8') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q76 ('ηVd/F (%)', value '84.3') — already have one for this compound
- routed 'εadd (ng/mL)' → Q317 (add_error) to residual_error — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=tiapride
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- companion parameter table 2 transcribed (50 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2, 3
