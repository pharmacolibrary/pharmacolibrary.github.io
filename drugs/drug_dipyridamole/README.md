A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

| popPK | Xi_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of the radiotracer 99mTc-3SPboroxime, using dipyridamole only as a stress agent, and does not report PK parameters for dipyridamole itself. |
| PGx | Yang_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the efflux transporters of bisdemethoxycurcumin-O-glucuronide, using dipyridamole only as a chemical inhibitor, and does not report pharmacogenomic effects on dipyridamole's PK or PD. |
| PGx | Zhang_2009 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates in vitro metabolism and drug-drug interactions of dipyridamole but does not report any pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants) on its PK or PD parameters. |
| PGx | van_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper uses dipyridamole as a reference compound in a computational screen to identify other drugs that potentiate statins; it does not report how a specific gene variant or genotype alters the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters of dipyridamole itself. |
