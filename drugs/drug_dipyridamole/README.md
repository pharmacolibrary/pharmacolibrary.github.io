## About

Dipyridamole is a medication that prevents blood clots from forming and also widens blood vessels, so it is used as an antiplatelet drug to stop platelets from clumping together. It is an approved medicine, listed as a platelet aggregation inhibitor under the antithrombotic group of the ATC classification, and is also being studied for additional uses.

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

| PGx | Wright_2023 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a cost-effectiveness analysis of a genetic test for clopidogrel and does not report pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data for dipyridamole. |
| popPK | Xi_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of the radiotracer 99mTc-3SPboroxime, using dipyridamole only as a stress agent, and does not report PK parameters for dipyridamole itself. |
| PGx | Yang_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the efflux transporters of bisdemethoxycurcumin-O-glucuronide, using dipyridamole only as a chemical inhibitor, and does not report pharmacogenomic effects on dipyridamole's PK or PD. |
| PGx | Zhang_2009 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates in vitro metabolism and drug-drug interactions of dipyridamole but does not report any pharmacogenomic effects (gene variants) on its PK or PD parameters. |
| PGx | van_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper uses dipyridamole as a reference compound to identify other drugs that potentiate statin activity, but it does not report how a specific gene variant or genotype alters the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters of dipyridamole itself. |
