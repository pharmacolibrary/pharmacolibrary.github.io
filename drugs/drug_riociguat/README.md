<small>Summary written by `glm-5.3-flash` from [Wikidata Q2154494](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2154494) and the WHO ATC classification and the EMA medicines list; not checked by a person.</small>

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Frey_2018 | irrelevant | 2 | 3 | The paper is a review article that summarizes pharmacokinetic data from other studies rather than reporting original quantitative disposition parameters or population-PK model estimates. |
| PD | Saleh_2016 | not_relevant | 4 | 2 | The abstract describes a PK/PD analysis but only reports qualitative correlations (6MWD vs. hemodynamics) and PK parameters, without providing specific numeric PD parameters (e.g., Emax, EC50) or a defined concentration-effect curve. |
| popPK | Willmann_2023 | relevant | 10 | 2 | The paper is a population PK study for riociguat, but the evidence only provides median apparent clearance values, lacking the specific model parameter estimates (e.g., typical CL, V, Q, ka) and variability parameters typically required for extraction. |
