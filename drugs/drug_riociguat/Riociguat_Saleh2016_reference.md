**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The riociguat parent–metabolite record was held back because its model structure (a one-compartment enteral model) did not match the required parent–metabolite structure, and bioavailability F and lag time Tlag were left at library defaults instead of being estimated from the paper.**

The record describes riociguat (kabs 2.17 /h, CL 1.81 L/h, V 32.3 L) with metabolite M1 (kabs 0.258 /h, CL 3.16 L/h, V 124 L) formed from the parent via metabolism, but the obtained one-compartment enteral structure did not match the expected parent–metabolite structure. The model builder substituted defaults for the bioavailability F and lag time Tlag, so these values affect the simulated profile without support from the paper. The record was also built from the abstract alone, so summary statistics stood in for a fitted model, and a second reader could not confirm the dose compound, primary analyte, or the riociguat parameter values (2.17 /h, 1.81 L/h, 32.3 L). Extracted — riociguat: kabs 2.17 /h, CL 1.81 L/h, V 32.3 L; M1: kabs 0.258 /h, CL 3.16 L/h, V 124 L.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has riociguat, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 7 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['F', 'Tlag']

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: '% increase' (CL)
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('Riociguat clearance', value 120) — already have one for this compound
- metabolite volume: 'M1 volume of distribution' Q63→Q61 for M1 — it is 1-compartment, so its central volume is its only volume
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q22 (riociguat clearance); Q61 (riociguat volume of distribution); Q22 (M1 clearance); Q61 (M1 volume of distribution)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=riociguat
- template fit: PK_Parent_Metabolite — one metabolite formed from central, both 1-compartment
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 7/7 row label(s) assigned, 6 linked by role; re-tagged riociguat→parent ×5, riociguat→M1 ×3
- molar mass: no plausible PubChem entry for 'M1' ('riociguat N-oxide') — left in mass units
- molar mass: none found for 'M1' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from abstract in Saleh_2016_metadata.yaml (8 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
