<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Escobar_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | Isoflurane is only the anesthetic background; the quantified PK parameters are for methadone, not isoflurane. |
| popPK | Fux_2022 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The evidence is about metamizole metabolites in calves; isoflurane is only the anesthetic co-administered, and no isoflurane PK parameters are reported. |
| popPK | Pypendop_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is about butorphanol in cats anesthetized with isoflurane, so isoflurane is only a co-administered anesthetic and no isoflurane PK parameters are reported. |
| popPK | Pypendop_2023 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is about buprenorphine/norbuprenorphine PK in isoflurane-anesthetized cats, so isoflurane is only the anesthetic background, not the subject drug. |
| popPK | Steagall_2020 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is about buprenorphine in dogs, while isoflurane is only an anesthetic co-administered background factor and no isoflurane PK parameters are reported. |
| popPK | White_2022 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is about alfaxalone PK; isoflurane is only used as anesthesia, not the subject drug. |
