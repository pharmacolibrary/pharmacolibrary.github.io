**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**CL has no unit.**

Without a unit the value cannot be converted, so the model cannot use it. Extracted — daunorubicin: V1 22.4 L, V2 1.39e+03 L, V3 330 L, Q 75.1 L/h, Q2 135 L/h; daunorubicinol: Q 573 L/h, V2 79.2 L, allometric_exponent 0.98, kfm 3.9 1/h, CL 35.8 L/h, CL 1.04.

Independently confirmed by `gpt-oss:120b`.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `needs_review` (reviewed 2026-10-05 09:26:07.107582+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-06 16:52:07.305553+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `daunorubicin`, measured `daunorubicin and daunorubicinol`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'β BSA (m2) on V5' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['pharmaceutics-14-00792-t002:row10:col1'])
- dropped duplicate Q305 ('Kp3m (1/h)', value '0.25') — already have one for this compound
- covariate effect for Q335 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- implicit units: 'Kp1m (1/h)' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'The paper describes Kp1m as a metabolite transformation rate but does not state its unit. As a first-order transformatio')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=daunorubicin and daunorubicinol
- template fit: PK_3M_9C — formed from central; parent 3, metabolites [1]
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 14/14 row label(s) assigned, 20 linked by role; re-tagged parent→daunorubicin and daunorubicinol ×2, parent→daunorubicinol ×13
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
