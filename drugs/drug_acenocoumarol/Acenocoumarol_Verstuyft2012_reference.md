**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The S-acenocoumarol record was rejected because the interconversion link between acenocoumarol and S-acenocoumarol carries no parameter value, leaving the metabolite effectively unlinked, and the central volume V1 of 0.2 L is physiologically implausible.**

The link from acenocoumarol to S-acenocoumarol is listed as interconversion but has no link parameter (kind unknown), so the metabolite compartment has no quantified path from the dose. The central compartment volume V1 is 0.2 L, outside the plausible physiological window, consistent with a unit or scale extraction error. Additionally, a reported unit could not be converted to SI, so that parameter reached the record without an SI value. Extracted — S-acenocoumarol: kabs 1.83 h -1, Q 0.173 L/h, V2 2.77 L, CLm/F 0.18 L h, V1 0.2 L, tlag 0.269 h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the links between molecules: this record has acenocoumarol → s-acenocoumarol (interconversion); acenocoumarol → r-acenocoumarol (interconversion), the second reading none → none (none); it also differs on 2 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

**Parameterization:** CLm/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- salvaged Q49 ('k a (h -1 )'=1.83) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q30 ('Q (L h)'=0.173) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q64 ('V 2 (L)'=2.77) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q22 ('o CL'=0.18) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q63 ('o V1'=0.2) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q83 ('Lag time'=0.269) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- implicit units: 'Q (L h)' → L/h (from the paper text: "Table III caption/footnotes and text state 'Q (L h)' and 'CL (L h)' where 'L h' denotes L/h (Liters per hour), consisten")
- metabolite s-acenocoumarol: Q22→Q351 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=S-acenocoumarol
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- text-pointer recovery found no readable extracted parameter table
