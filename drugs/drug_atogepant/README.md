<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Boinpally_2023 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study reports only summary exposure metrics (AUC, Cmax, Tmax) for a drug interaction assessment, lacking the compartmental or population PK parameters (CL, V, Q, ka) required for extraction. |
| PGx | Boinpally_2023_2 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates drug-drug interactions (CYP3A4/OATP inhibition/induction) rather than the effect of a specific gene variant or genotype on pharmacokinetics. |
| PGx | Boinpally_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The study evaluates a drug-drug interaction (quinidine) rather than a pharmacogenomic effect (gene variant/genotype). |
| popPK | Boinpally_2025_2 | relevant | 4 | 5 | The study reports non-compartmental PK parameters (Cmax, AUC, t1/2) for atogepant in lactating women, but lacks compartmental model parameters (CL, V, Q) and specific numeric values for half-life are not explicitly listed in the provided text. |
| popPK | Boinpally_2026 | irrelevant | 2 | 1 | The study reports CSF/plasma concentration ratios and specific plasma/CSF concentrations at discrete time points, but does not provide compartmental PK parameters (CL, V, Q, ka) or a population PK model for atogepant. |
| PD | Boinpally_2026 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The paper reports PK parameters (CSF/plasma ratios) and cites a preclinical EC50 value, but does not report any clinical exposure-response or dose-response analysis with numeric PD parameters for atogepant. |
| popPK | Iannone_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a clinical trial assessing sleep quality and adverse events, not a pharmacokinetic study, and reports no quantitative disposition parameters for atogepant. |
| popPK | Iannone_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical efficacy and tolerability study (real-world evaluation) that reports no pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance, volume, or half-life. |
| PGx | Mehta_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports on drug-drug interactions (CYP3A4 inhibition) and clinical safety outcomes, not pharmacogenomic effects of gene variants on PK/PD parameters. |
| popPK | Schlachter_2026_2 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The paper is an exposure-response modeling study that uses predicted exposures from a separate population PK model rather than reporting original quantitative PK parameters (CL, V, etc.) for atogepant. |
| PGx | Takizawa_2023 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a narrative review discussing drug-drug interactions (CYP3A4) and does not report pharmacogenomic effects of gene variants on atogepant PK/PD. |
| PGx | Yu_2022 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (CYP3A inhibition/induction) for atogepant, not pharmacogenomic effects based on gene variants. |
