**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**The atogepant model was quarantined because clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, lag time and the intercompartmental rate constants had no source values and library placeholder defaults were substituted.**

The record lists apparent parameters for atogepant (e.g. CL/F 18.2 L/h, V1/F 72.9 L, ka 1.31 /h, tlag 0.298 h), but the model builder substituted placeholder defaults for clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, lag time, and the central↔peripheral rate constants, and invented the absorption rate constant since it was not reported in the source. The parameterization assumes F=1 and Fm=1 with no molar correction. In addition, the covariate effects defined in the record (e.g. the dose effect on relative bioavailability, 0.163) were never exercised in simulation — only the reference individual was simulated — and a second reader disagreed on which parameters carry power-form covariate effects and on the value 0.163, which this record assigns to the dose effect but the second reader assigns to a relative-bioavailability weight power. Extracted — atogepant: kabs 1.31, CL/F 18.2, V1/F 72.9, Q/F 0.771, V2/F 91.7, Q2/F 1.99, V3/F 22.3, tlag 0.298, … (+1).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has atogepant, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 8 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('Apparent clearance healthy participants [CL/F (L/h)]', value '18.2') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Blood-plasma ratio' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab2:row17:col2'])
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('Itraconazole effect on CL/F', value '-0.691') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('Rifampin effect on CL/F following multiple doses', value '1.10') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q83 ('Effect of solution on ALAG', value '-0.191') — already have one for this compound
- covariate level 'Exponential effect of dose on Frel' → Q900:exponential_effect_of_dose_on_frel = 0.163 (power on Q27)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=atogepant
- structure disagreement: deterministic 2C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count
- bound model equation to Q40 (Fab): F = 86.1 * (bodyweight/76.8)^
- Q40 (Fab) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'F'; equation kept verbatim
- population split: 'phase 2 modela' subgroup of Schlachter_2026 (paper reports 3 populations: phase 1 model, phase 2 modela, phase 3 modela)
