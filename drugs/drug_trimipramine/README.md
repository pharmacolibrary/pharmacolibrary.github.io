<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>gene</code></td><td>the gene whose variants the record is about. One record per gene, so a paper reporting several genes appears on several rows.</td></tr><tr><td><code>affects</code></td><td>the PK or PD parameter the genotype SHIFTS, as an ontology Q-code plus its name — Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F (apparent clearance), Q32 = Cmax, Q88 = AUC, Q40 = Fab, Q321 = EC50, Q322 = IC50, Q305 = kfm. The record's per-phenotype theta is a multiplier ON that parameter: a poor-metaboliser theta shifts this value, it does not supply one. Two values are NOT parameters — Q100 (NIL) is an association or risk finding with no parameter target, and `safety` is an adverse-reaction risk such as an HLA allele. A PA… id instead of a Q-code marks a record derived from a ClinPGx/PharmGKB guideline lookup rather than read out of the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>mechanism</code></td><td>how the gene acts: metabolism, transport, target, formation, safety_allele, or unknown.</td></tr><tr><td><code>detail</code></td><td>the paper stem, linking to the full record page.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>not verified</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state (see the badge and the note above the table); the numbers are shown as extracted, not endorsed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
