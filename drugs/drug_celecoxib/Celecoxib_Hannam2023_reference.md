<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

</details>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The model does not reproduce the paper's terminal half-life (paper 0.84, model 4.63).**

Simulated as the paper dosed it, the model's terminal half-life differs from the value the paper reports by more than the tolerance. A reported unit could not be converted (Ct), so that value has no SI equivalent. Extracted — celecoxib: t1/2z 49.2 h, Ct 12.5 µg˙L−1, CL 49 L/h/70 kg, V 346 L/70 kg.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has celecoxib, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 8 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped value-less row: 'TF'
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Plasma RUV_PROP (%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Hannam_2023_table_p5_2:row3:col1'])
- dropped duplicate Q75 ('CSF RUV_ADO (µg˙L−1)', value '10.4') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'CSF RUV_PROP (%)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Hannam_2023_table_p5_2:row5:col1'])
- dropped value-less row: 'Agut'
- dropped value-less row: 'Ka'
- dropped value-less row: 'T LAG'
- dropped value-less row: 'V'
- dropped value-less row: 'Keq'
- dropped value-less row: 'CL'
- dropped value-less row: 'Cp'
- dropped value-less row: 'CCSF'
- salvaged Q22 ('Estimated celecoxib clearance'=49) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q61 ('volume of distribution'=346) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=celecoxib
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- unit re-normalised: V 'L/70 kg' now converts (value unchanged)

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- unparsed cell Hannam_2023_table_p5_2:row0:col3 = '0.544, 1.13'
