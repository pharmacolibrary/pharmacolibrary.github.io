A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The celecoxib model for cockatiels was quarantined because clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and lag time had no extracted values and library placeholder defaults were substituted, including an invented absorption rate constant.**

The record reports only V/F = 19.12 for celecoxib; clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time had no value in the source, so placeholder numbers would have stood in for the missing parameters and the model was held back rather than published with invented values. The absorption rate constant was invented — not reported in the source — which the deviations check flagged as not acceptable. The model also assumes F=1 and Fm=1 with no molar correction (apparent parameterization) and uses first-order depot input for extravascular dosing. A second reader additionally disagreed on which parameter the reported V/F value corresponds to, and on several half-life and fraction entries that were null in this record. Extracted — celecoxib: V/F 19.1.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[po cf 1].parameter_id`: this record has Q76, the second reading Q27; it also differs on 5 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.
