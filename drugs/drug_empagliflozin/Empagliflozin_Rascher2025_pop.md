**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The empagliflozin paediatric model was quarantined because volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time had no source values and were replaced by placeholder numbers, with all six parameters recorded as 1.00.**

Empagliflozin's V2/F, Q/F, V3/F, CL/F, kabs and D1 all carry the value 1.00, and the volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time had no value in the source, so a placeholder stood in; the absorption rate constant was invented rather than reported. A coverage check found only 2 of 4 expected parameters covered, with V2/F and Q/F neither emitted nor defaulted. A second reader disputed every value, reading CL/F as 6.74 L/h, V2/F as 4.12 L, kabs as 0.239 1/h, Q/F as 5.51 L/h, V3/F as 71.7 L and D1 as 0.326 h. The model also assumes apparent parameterization with F=1, Fm=1 and no molar correction. Extracted — empagliflozin: CL/F 1 L/h, V2/F 1 L, kabs 1, Q/F 1 L/h, V3/F 1 L, D1 1 h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on `parameters[cl/f].value`: this record has 1.00, the second reading 6.74; it also differs on 5 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'ȓ' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('EGFRCL/F', value '1.00') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'BLACKCL/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['bcp70096-tbl-0003:row10:col7'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ASIANCL/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['bcp70096-tbl-0003:row11:col7'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'FEMALECL/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['bcp70096-tbl-0003:row12:col7'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ΩCL/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['bcp70096-tbl-0003:row14:col7'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=empagliflozin
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- population split: 'ȓ' subgroup of Rascher_2025 (paper reports 4 populations: bulk ess, median, tail ess, ȓ)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
