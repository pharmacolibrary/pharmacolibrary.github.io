A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The empagliflozin three-compartment model for type 2 diabetes patients was quarantined because clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time had no source values and library placeholders were substituted.**

Although the record lists CL 0.0110, V2 1.27, Q/F 6.34, V3 0.959 and kabs 1.23, the coverage check found only 2 of 4 expected parameters emitted or defaulted, with V2 and Q/F neither emitted nor defaulted. The model builder substituted generic placeholder values for empagliflozin's clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant and absorption lag time, and the absorption rate constant was flagged as invented since it was not reported in the source. Bioavailability was assumed F=1 and Fm=1 with no molar correction, making the parameterization apparent. A second reader assigned an absorption lag time of 0.500 where this record has none. Extracted — empagliflozin: CL 0.011, V2 1.27, Q/F 6.34, V3 0.959, kabs 1.23.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of alag1: this record has none, the second reading 0.500. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ALAG1' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Baron_2016_table_S1:row30:col1'])
- dropped value-less row: '*'
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=empagliflozin
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
