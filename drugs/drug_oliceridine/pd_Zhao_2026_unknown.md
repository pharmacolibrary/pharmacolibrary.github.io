<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Remifentanil (measured concentrations) drives cardiovascular response to tracheal intubation (in unknown): direct Emax (saturable) effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Remifentanil effect-site/infusion concentrations (ng/mL) were titrated (Dixon up-and-down, probit regression) against the binary cardiovascular response to tracheal intubation (≥15% change in HR or MAP), with IV bolus oliceridine 0.015 or 0.03 mg/kg given before induction; the paper does not state a mechanistic PD model (no Emax/IC50/kin/kout/ke0), only that oliceridine reduced the EC50 of remifentanil for inhibiting the intubation response from 3.728 ng/mL (95% CI 3.536–3.943) in controls to 3.045 ng/mL (95% CI 2.852–3.239) with 0.015 mg/kg oliceridine (high-dose EC50 not reported in the excerpts), versus 2.824 ng/mL (95% CI 2.620–3.015) with sufentanil 0.15 μg/kg.

<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label (paper)</code></td><td>the row or statistic label exactly as printed in the paper (label_verbatim) — never normalised, so it can be found in the PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Q-code · name</code></td><td>the ontology parameter this label was matched to (Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F, Q49 = ka, Q57 = half-life, …) and its canonical name. The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.
