## About

**Description.** Severe acute pain occurs through nociceptive signalling involving both ascending and descending spinal pathways, in which nerve conductance is mediated in part by the action of opioid receptors.[A218041, A218046] Opioid receptors are seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), of which the μ-opioid receptor subtype is predominantly targeted by and is responsible for the effects of opioid agonists.[A218031, A218046] However, due to the ability of some opioid agonists to bind to other targets, as well as activation of additional downstream pathways from opioid receptors such as those involving β-arrestin, the beneficial analgesic effects of opioids are coupled with severe adverse effects such as constipation and respiratory depression.[A218026, A218031, A218036, A218041, A218046]

Oliceridine (formerly known as TRV130) is a "biased agonist" at the μ-opioid receptor by preferentially activating the G-protein pathway with minimal receptor phosphorylation and recruitment of β-arrestin.[A218026, A218031] By acting as a biased agonist, oliceridine provides comparable analgesia compared with traditional opioids such as [morphine] at a comparable or decreased risk of opioid-related adverse effects such as constipation and respiratory depression.[A218026, A218031, A218051, A218056, A218061, A218066, A218071, L15516]

Oliceridine was first reported in 2013,[A218026, A218086] but was initially not approved by the FDA due to concerns raised by the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee.[A218041] Oliceridine gained FDA approval on August 7, 2020, and is currently marketed by Trevena Inc as OLINVYK™.[L15516]

**Indication.** Oliceridine is indicated for the management of acute pain in adults severe enough to require intravenous opioid analgesics and for whom no acceptable alternative treatments exist.[L15516]

The record's per-phenotype theta is a multiplier ON that parameter: a poor-metaboliser theta shifts this value, it does not supply one. Two values are NOT parameters — Q100 (NIL) is an association or risk finding with no parameter target, and `safety` is an adverse-reaction risk such as an HLA allele. A PA… id instead of a Q-code marks a record derived from a ClinPGx/PharmGKB guideline lookup rather than read out of the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>mechanism</code></td><td>how the gene acts: metabolism, transport, target, formation, safety_allele, or unknown.</td></tr><tr><td><code>detail</code></td><td>the paper stem, linking to the full record page.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
