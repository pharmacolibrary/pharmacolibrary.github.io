| popPK | Wehrfritz_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of dipyrone (metamizole) and its metabolites, not alteplase. |
| PD | Wehrfritz_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper analyzes the pharmacokinetics of dipyrone (metamizole), not alteplase, and does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response parameters. |
| PGx | Weston_2007 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies photosynthesis and Rubisco activase in red maple trees, not pharmacogenomics or alteplase. |
| popPK | Wooster_1999 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of reteplase, and while it mentions alteplase as a comparator, it does not report quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters for alteplase. |
| PD | Wooster_1999 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is a qualitative review of reteplase that mentions alteplase only for comparison of mechanism and clinical outcomes, without providing any numeric PD parameters or exposure-response data for alteplase. |
| PGx | Xu_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies heat tolerance in fine fescue plants, not pharmacogenomics of alteplase. |
| PGx | Xu_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates a pharmacological combination therapy (PAI-1 inhibitor + rtPA) rather than the effect of a specific gene variant or genotype on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. |
| popPK | Yang_2023 | relevant | 8 | 2 | The paper is an in silico PK-PD study of alteplase that uses a compartmental model, but the specific numeric PK parameter values (clearance, volume, rate constants) are referenced as being in Tables 1 and 2 or previous studies, which are not fully provided in the evidence. |
| popPK | Yang_2024 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The paper is an in silico simulation study that does not report original quantitative pharmacokinetic parameter values (such as clearance or volume) for alteplase. |
| popPK | Yong_2024 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a clinical cohort analysis of treatment outcomes for pleural infections and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, t1/2) for alteplase. |
| popPK | den_1998 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical efficacy trial comparing lanoteplase and alteplase, reporting angiographic outcomes rather than pharmacokinetic parameters for alteplase. |
