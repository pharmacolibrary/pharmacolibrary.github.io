## About

**Description.** Alteplase is a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) used as a thrombolytic agent.[L43125] It cleaves plasminogen to form plasmin, an enzyme involved in the degradation of fibrin clots. In the absence of fibrin, the alteplase-mediated conversion of plasminogen is limited, thanks to the high affinity between alteplase and fibrin.[A252330,L43125] Alteplase is a purified glycoprotein of 527 amino acids expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.[A252345,L43125] It was first approved by the FDA in 1987 for the management of thromboembolic disease, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI).[A252270] The use of alteplase to manage AMI has decreased thanks to the availability of safer treatments such as angioplasty and stenting. However, its use for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has increased over the years.[A252340] New thrombolytic agents derived from tissue plasminogen activator, such as [desmoteplase], [tenecteplase] and [reteplase], have also been developed.[A252270,A252345] Alteplase is also available as Cathflo Activase (intracatheter instillation) for the restoration of function to central venous access devices.[L34864]

**Indication.** Alteplase is indicated for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and for use in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for the reduction of mortality and incidence of heart failure. Alteplase is also indicated for the lysis of acute massive pulmonary embolism, defined as acute pulmonary emboli obstructing blood flow to a lobe or multiple lung segments, and acute pulmonary emboli accompanied by unstable hemodynamics.[L43125]

| PD | Wang_2021 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of meropenem and dose optimization based on PK targets (T&gt;MIC), not on the pharmacodynamics (PD) of alteplase. |
| popPK | Wang_2024 | irrelevant | 2 | 1 | The paper is a review of tenecteplase where alteplase serves as a comparator, and the only alteplase PK value (clearance) is a single animal data point cited from a reference rather than original study data. |
| PD | Wang_2024 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The paper is a narrative review comparing tenecteplase and alteplase that cites animal PK/PD data (e.g., clearance, fibrin specificity) and clinical trial outcomes, but it does not present or derive numeric PD parameters (Emax, EC50, etc.) or an exposure-response curve for alteplase in the text provided. |
| popPK | Wehrfritz_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of dipyrone (metamizole), not alteplase. |
| PD | Wehrfritz_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper analyzes the pharmacokinetics of dipyrone (metamizole), not alteplase, and does not report any pharmacodynamic or exposure-response parameters. |
| PGx | Weston_2007 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies plant physiology (Rubisco activase in maple trees) and has no relation to human pharmacogenomics or alteplase. |
| popPK | Wooster_1999 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of reteplase, and while it mentions alteplase as a comparator, it does not report quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters for alteplase. |
| PD | Wooster_1999 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The paper is a qualitative review of reteplase that mentions alteplase only for comparison of mechanism and clinical outcomes, without providing any numeric PD parameters or exposure-response data for alteplase. |
| PGx | Xu_2018 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies heat tolerance in fine fescue plants and is unrelated to human pharmacogenomics or alteplase. |
| PGx | Xu_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates a pharmacological combination therapy (PAI-1 inhibitor + rtPA) rather than the effect of a specific gene variant or genotype on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. |
| popPK | Yang_2023 | relevant | 8 | 2 | The paper is an in silico PK-PD study of alteplase that uses a compartmental model, but the specific numeric PK parameter values (clearance, volume, rate constants) are referenced as being in Tables 1 and 2 or previous studies, which are not fully provided in the evidence. |
| popPK | Yang_2024 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The paper is an in silico simulation study that does not report original quantitative pharmacokinetic parameter values (such as clearance or volume) for alteplase. |
| popPK | Yong_2024 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical cohort study evaluating treatment outcomes and dosing efficacy, not a pharmacokinetic study, and contains no PK parameters. |
| popPK | den_1998 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical efficacy trial comparing lanoteplase and alteplase, reporting angiographic outcomes rather than pharmacokinetic parameters for alteplase. |
