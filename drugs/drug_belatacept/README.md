<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Ashokkumar_2015 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | This is an in-vitro immunological study assessing T-cell sensitivity (EC50) to belatacept, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting disposition parameters like clearance or volume. |
| popPK | Ashokkumar_2026 | irrelevant | 1 | 1 | The study reports in vitro pharmacodynamic EC50 values for B-cell suppression, not pharmacokinetic disposition parameters like clearance or volume of distribution. |
| popPK | Klaasen_2019 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The study describes the development of an assay and mentions a PK model visualization but does not report specific quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, etc.) in the provided text. |
| popPK | Pyatt_2025 | relevant | 9 | 2 | The study is a population PK analysis of belatacept in humans, but the specific numeric parameter values (CL, V, etc.) are not present in the text, likely residing in tables or supplementary materials not included. |
| popPK | Sethi_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports clinical outcomes (survival, rejection, GFR) of an immunosuppression switch, not pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| popPK | Younis_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | This is a clinical outcomes study focusing on donor-specific antibodies in lung transplant patients, reporting no pharmacokinetic parameters for belatacept. |
| popPK | Zhou_2012 | relevant | 10 | 0 | The paper explicitly describes a population pharmacokinetic model for belatacept in kidney transplant recipients, but the extracted evidence contains only qualitative descriptions of covariate effects without any specific numeric parameter values (e.g., CL, V, Q). |
