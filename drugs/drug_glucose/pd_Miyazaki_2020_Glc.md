<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Insulin drives plasma glucose (in mg/dL): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of plasma glucose.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Insulin (intravenous bolus doses 0.05–0.5 IU/kg, and 0.5 IU/kg infusions/pulses) lowers plasma glucose, described by an indirect response model in which insulin's signal (SIG, with maximum effect Smax, SC50 producing 50% of Smax, and Hill constant r) inhibits endogenous glucose production (zero-order rate constant KGin), while glucose elimination proceeds with first-order rate constant kGout (min−1); the baseline glucose G00 is 105.12 mg/dL, maintained by KGin = kGout·G00. The paper does not state the numerical values of Smax, SC50, r, KGin or kGout in the excerpts (they are in Supplementary Tables), and an IR-GT model combining insulin receptor binding and GLUT4 translocation best described

## Models

<p>No downloads: this record is <b>rejected</b>, so it is not published as a model. Any archives generated for it before the verdict have been removed — a download outlives the page that explains it.</p>

<div class="pk-tab-mark" data-tab="Simulation"></div>

_No web simulator for this record: its structure has no shared WebAssembly template. The FMI archive under **Models** carries its own compiled FMU._
