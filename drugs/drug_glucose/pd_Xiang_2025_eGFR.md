<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Tacrolimus (measured concentrations) drives eGFR (in unknown): direct Emax (saturable) effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Tacrolimus trough concentration (C0, ng/mL) was linked to eGFR (as ReGFR relative to the day-7 post-transplant baseline) via an Imax (maximal inhibitory effect) model, in which tacrolimus exposure inhibits renal function (nephrotoxicity); the paper does not describe an indirect turnover mechanism. IC50 was fixed at 10 ng/mL and Imax at 30 mL/min/1.73 m2; no other potency or rate parameters (e.g., kin, kout, ke0, gamma) are given.

> <sub>in the paper's terms — summarised by glm-5.3-flash from the paper's text; not checked by a person</sub>

- **paper:** `Xiang_2025`
- **model family:** `emax`
- **driver:** `conc_no_pk`
- **tier:** population
- **effect:** unknown/unknown
