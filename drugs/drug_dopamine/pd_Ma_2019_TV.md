<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Axitinib drives tumor volume (in unknown): indirect response — drug inhibits the loss of tumor volume.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Axitinib plasma concentrations inhibit tumor growth in MCF-7/ADR xenografts via an indirect response (Model II) mechanism, with kmax 1.60 per day and kC50 2.10 mg/L (tumor volume model); tumor growth parameters include λ0 0.229 per day and λ1 273 mm³/day, with axitinib PK described by ka 78.7 per day, V/F 16.5 L/kg, and CL/F 319 L/kg/day.
