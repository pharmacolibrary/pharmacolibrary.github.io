## About

**Description.** Sotatercept is an activin signalling inhibitor. It is a homodimeric recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of the human activin receptor type IIA (ActRIIA) linked to the human IgG1 Fc domain.[L50351]

On March 26, 2024, sotatercept was approved by the FDA for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).[L50361] Sotatercept works to resolve the imbalance in activin–growth differentiation factor and BMP pathway signalling observed in PAH.[A263481] Sotatercept was approved by the European Commission on August 26, 2024.[L51549]

**Indication.** Sotatercept is indicated for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, World Health Organization [WHO] Group 1) to increase exercise capacity, improve WHO functional class (FC), and reduce the risk of clinical worsening events, including hospitalization for PAH, lung transplantation, and death.[L50351, L54526]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
