<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PD | Ait-Oudhia_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses exclusively on population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and does not report pharmacodynamic (PD) or exposure-response relationships. |
| popPK | Ait-Oudhia_2025 | irrelevant | 3 | 1 | The paper describes exposure-response (E-R) and PK/PD models for efficacy and safety endpoints but does not report the structural population PK parameters (CL, V, Q, ka) or a standalone population PK model for sotatercept. |
| PGx | Bose_2019 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review of myelofibrosis treatments and does not mention sotatercept, genetic variants, or pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| popPK | Cabré_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a narrative review of cardiovascular pharmacotherapy that does not report any quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters for sotatercept. |
| PD | Cabré_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The text is a narrative review of cardiovascular pharmacotherapy and does not contain any specific data, analysis, or numeric parameters for sotatercept. |
| popPK | Coyne_2019 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports clinical efficacy and safety outcomes (hemoglobin, bone density, vascular calcification) but contains no pharmacokinetic parameters or disposition data for sotatercept. |
| PGx | Miranda_2025 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper states that BMPR2 genetic variant status was not associated with significant differences in treatment effects, reporting a lack of pharmacogenomic effect rather than describing a specific PK/PD parameter modification. |
| popPK | Rothman_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study investigates the pharmacokinetics of imatinib, not sotatercept. |
| popPK | Sherman_2013 | relevant | 8 | 2 | The paper is a PK study of sotatercept reporting a terminal half-life, but lacks other quantitative disposition parameters like clearance or volume of distribution in the provided text. |
| PGx | Yoshida_2026 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a clinical trial protocol for sotatercept in pulmonary arterial hypertension and does not report any pharmacogenomic data or associations between genetic variants and PK/PD parameters. |
