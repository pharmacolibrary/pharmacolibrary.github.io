<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Bitopertin drives reticulocyte count (in 10^6/L): indirect response — drug inhibits the loss of reticulocyte count.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Bitopertin exposure (AUC) acts on the reticulocyte count (10^6/L) via an indirect mechanism: it inhibits hemoglobin production (Mechanism D2) and the hemoglobin-driven feedback on reticulocyte precursor recruitment (Mechanism D1), described in the record as an indirect response model with proportional inhibition. Key parameters are Imax,bitopertin = 0.6, AUC50,bitopertin = 16.50 (8.91% RSE, 49.50% CV IIV), and an erythrocyte lifespan kTOL = 0.022 (12.86% RSE) corresponding to a typical LSRBC of 125 days.
