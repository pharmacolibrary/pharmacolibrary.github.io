<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Model component
<dbs-pgx drug="lecanemab" model-id="Lecanemab_Hayato2022_reference" status="rejected" stale="false" population="adults with early Alzheimer&#39;s disease" measured-compound="lecanemab" parameterization="mechanistic" topology="2C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 2-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 5 extracted, plus 6 covariate effects.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

- table section iiv: 'V 2' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (CV%)')

- table section residual_error: 'Proportional: study 104' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability (CV%)')
- table section residual_error: 'Proportional: study 201' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability (CV%)')
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Females ~ CL (ratio)' → Q31 (unit 'dimensionless' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Females ~ V 1 (ratio)' → Q63 (unit 'dimensionless' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q63 ('Females ~ V 1 (ratio)', value '0.893') — already have one for this compound
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'shrinkage' from footnote/prose loose number 9.96 (source ['psp412862-tbl-0001:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'V1' from footnote/prose loose number 30.5 (source ['psp412862-tbl-0001:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'V2' from footnote/prose loose number 31.7 (source ['psp412862-tbl-0001:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'Frel' from footnote/prose loose number 63.2 (source ['psp412862-tbl-0001:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review

- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'V2' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['psp412862-tbl-0001:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- covariate effect for Q87 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- covariate effect for Q319 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=lecanemab
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- molar mass: none found for 'lecanemab' — its concentrations stay mass-only
