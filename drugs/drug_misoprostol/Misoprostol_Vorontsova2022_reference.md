<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**The misoprostol acid model was rejected because the Michaelis–Menten parameters carry wrong dimensions: Vmax is reported as 5.45 pg/ml (a concentration, not a metabolic rate) and Km as 2.5 pg (an amount, not a concentration).**

For misoprostol acid in women undergoing labor induction at term, the record lists Vmax/Fb = 5.45 with unit pg/ml, but Vmax is the maximum rate of metabolism by an enzymatic reaction and should have rate dimensions, not concentration. Km = 2.5 pg likewise uses an amount unit where a substrate concentration is expected, so the structural parameter failed the dimension check. The reported units could not be converted to SI, so the parameters reached the model without usable SI values. The other parameters (CL/F 730 L/h, V/F 610 L, kabs 0.709 1/h for buccal 25 μg) are dimensionally consistent. Extracted — misoprostol acid: CL/F 730 L/h, V/F 610 L, kabs 0.709 buccal, 25 μg, Vmax 5.45 pg/ml, Km 2.5 pg.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Fv/b' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['cts13306-tbl-0002:row3:col1', 'cts13306-tbl-0002:row3:col2', 'cts13306-tbl-0002:row3:col3'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'buccal, 25 μg' (kabs)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'buccal, 50 μg' (kabs)
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('ka, 1/h (buccal, 50 μg)', value '0.537') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'vaginal, 25 μg' (kabs)
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('ka, 1/h (vaginal, 25 μg)', value '0.464') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'vaginal, 50 μg' (kabs)
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('ka, 1/h (vaginal, 50 μg)', value '0.24') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Vmax/Fb, pg/ml' → Q66 (unit '[mass] / [length] ** 3' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Km, pg' → Q1 (unit '[mass]' vs ontology '[mass] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=misoprostol acid
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
