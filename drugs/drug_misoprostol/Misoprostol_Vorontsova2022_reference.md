**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The misoprostol acid metabolite model was rejected because a structural parameter failed a dimensional check: Vmax/F is reported as 5.45 pg/ml, a concentration unit, not a rate as a maximum metabolism rate requires.**

For the misoprostol acid metabolite (formed from misoprostol, one compartment), the record lists Vmax/Fb = 5.45 pg/ml and Km = 2.5 pg; a maximum rate of enzymatic metabolism must have units of amount per time, so the pg/ml unit is dimensionally wrong for this parameter. The reported unit also could not be converted to SI, so the parameter arrived without an SI value. A second reader (gpt-oss:120b) disagreed with this record on several parameter fields, reading CL/Fb = 730 L/h, ka = 0.709 1/h, Km = 2.5, V/Fb = 610 L and Vmax/Fb = 5.45 where this record had nulls, and nulls where this record had those values, so the parameter extraction itself is contested. Extracted — misoprostol acid: CLm/F 730 L/h, V 610 L, kabs 0.709 1/h, Vmax 5.45 pg/ml, Km 2.5 pg.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on the value of cl/fb: this record has none, the second reading 730; it also differs on 9 more fields. That field does not shape the model.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Fv/b' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['cts13306-tbl-0002:row3:col1', 'cts13306-tbl-0002:row3:col2', 'cts13306-tbl-0002:row3:col3'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'buccal, 25 μg' (kabs)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'buccal, 50 μg' (kabs)
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('ka, 1/h (buccal, 50 μg)', value '0.537') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'vaginal, 25 μg' (kabs)
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('ka, 1/h (vaginal, 25 μg)', value '0.464') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'vaginal, 50 μg' (kabs)
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('ka, 1/h (vaginal, 50 μg)', value '0.24') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Vmax/Fb, pg/ml' → Q66 (unit '[mass] / [length] ** 3' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Km, pg' → Q1 (unit '[mass]' vs ontology '[mass] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- implicit units: 'ka, 1/h (buccal, 25 μg)' → 1/h (from the paper text: "The abstract explicitly states the unit for the absorption rate constant (ka) as h−1 (e.g., 'buccal 25 μg 0.724 (95% con")
- metabolite misoprostol acid: Q22→Q351 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- metabolite volume: 'V/Fb, L' Q63→Q61 for misoprostol acid — it is 1-compartment, so its central volume is its only volume
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=misoprostol acid
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles: 4 per-group rows of misoprostol acid absorption_rate_constant but 0 reference group(s) — kept as printed
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 9/9 row label(s) assigned, 18 linked by role
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
