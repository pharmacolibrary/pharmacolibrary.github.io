## About

**Description.** Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analog used to reduce the risk of NSAID related ulcers, manage miscarriages, prevent post partum hemorrhage, and also for first trimester abortions.[L7616,L7619,A181589,A181583,A181697] The stimulation of prostaglandin receptors in the stomach reduces gastric acid secretion, while stimulating these receptors in the uterus and cervix can increase the strength and frequency of contractions and decrease cervical tone.[A181586]

Misoprostol was granted FDA approval on 27 December 1988.[L7616]

**Indication.** Misoprostol is indicated as a tablet to reduce the risk of NSAID induced gastric ulcers but not duodenal ulcers in high risk patients.[L7616] Misoprostol is also formulated in combination with diclofenac to treat symptoms of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis in patients with a high risk of developing gastric ulcers.[L7619] Misoprostol is used off label for the management of miscarriages, prevention of post partum hemorrhage, and is also used alone or in combination with mifepristone in other countries for first trimester abortions.[A181589,A181583,A181697]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
