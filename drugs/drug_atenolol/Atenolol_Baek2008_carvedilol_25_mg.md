A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

**All ten extracted parameters describe carvedilol, not atenolol, leaving atenolol's clearance, volume, and lag time at placeholder defaults.**

The record lists AUC, Cmax, and clearance values for carvedilol, yet the drug is identified as atenolol. Consequently, atenolol's clearance, volume of distribution, and absorption lag time had no source values. A second reader also disagreed on the primary analyte and reported different parameter values. Extracted — carvedilol: AUCt 283 ng*h/mL, Cmax 62.7 ng/mL, tmax 1.26 h, V/F 1.56e+03 L, CL 94.6 L/h, kel 4.45 h⁻¹, kabs 4.52 h⁻¹, k21 0.19 h⁻¹, … (+2).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has atenolol, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 21 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'ng h/mL' (AUCt)
- dropped duplicate Q47 ('Kb (h⁻¹)', value '0.60') — already have one for this compound
- implicit units: 'AUC0-30hr (ng h/mL)' → ng*h/mL (from the paper text: "Table II caption and content list the parameter as '-AUC 0-30hr (ng•h/mL)'.")
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=atenolol
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- population split: 'carvedilol (25 mg)' subgroup of Baek_2008 (paper reports 2 populations: atenolol (50 mg), carvedilol (25 mg))
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2, 3
