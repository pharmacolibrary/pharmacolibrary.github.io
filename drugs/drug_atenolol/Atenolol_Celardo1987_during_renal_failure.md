> **Species: rabbit.** This record comes from an animal study (rabbit), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**Atenolol clearance and volume values are implausibly low, indicating a unit or scale extraction error.**

The total clearance of 0.086 L/h and central volume of 0.36 L fall outside physiological windows for this drug. A reported unit could not be converted to standard units, so the parameter lacked a valid value for review. The second reader disagreed on several extracted values, including blood clearance and mean residence time. Extracted — atenolol: λ1 3.98, λ2 0.039, t1/2α 0.21 h, t1/2β 18.1 h, V 0.36 L, Vss 2.03 L, CL 0.086 L/h, AUC 39.4 mg·h/L, … (+7).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has atenolol, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 6 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.
