> **Species: rabbit.** This record comes from an animal study (rabbit), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from an LLM reading of the title and abstract by gpt-6-luna, p(non-human) 1.00).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The record was rejected because the intercompartmental clearance value of 0.0028 L/h is physiologically implausible for atenolol.**

The intercompartmental clearance is recorded as 0.0028 L/h, a magnitude far below the expected physiological range for this molecule. This extreme value triggered a rejection for an implausible clearance-to-volume ratio. Additionally, a reported unit could not be converted to SI units, preventing the parameter from being processed. Extracted — atenolol: λ1 4.36, λ2 0.32, t1/2α 0.18 h, t1/2β 2.22 h, V 0.48 L, Vss 1.56 L, CL 0.58 L/h, AUC 5.34 mg·h/L, … (+8).

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has atenolol, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 6 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.
