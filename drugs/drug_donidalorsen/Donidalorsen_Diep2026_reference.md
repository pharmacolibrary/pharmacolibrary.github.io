**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**The donidalorsen record was quarantined because clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, absorption lag time and both intercompartmental rate constants had no source values and were left at library defaults.**

Although the paper reports apparent parameters for donidalorsen (CL/F 12.8 L/h, V1/F 69.8 L, Q/F 2.58 L/h, peripheral V/F 1840 L, ka 0.952 1/h), the model builder substituted library placeholder defaults for clearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, absorption lag time, and the central-to-peripheral and peripheral-to-central rate constants, so the model was held back rather than published with invented numbers. The builder also assumed F=1 and Fm=1 without molar correction, and the ka default was flagged as an invented absorption deviation. In addition, the covariate effects defined in the record (weight effects of 1.52 on CL/F and 1.79 on Q/F, plus further weight terms of 2.34 and 1.60) were not exercised: only the reference individual was simulated. Extracted — donidalorsen: CL/F 12.8, V1/F 69.8, Q/F 2.58, V/F 1.84e+03, kabs 0.952.

**Model structure:** 2-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 5 extracted, plus 4 covariate effects.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, Q/F, V/F, V1/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.
