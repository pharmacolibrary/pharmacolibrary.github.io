<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Donidalorsen (concentrations from this paper's PK model) drives prekallikrein (in mg/L): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of prekallikrein.

**Model:** A model was generated (see the **Models** tab); it has no in-browser simulator.

> Plasma donidalorsen concentration inhibits the zero-order production rate of prekallikrein (PKK, mg/L) in an indirect response model (Imax proportional inhibition, no Hill coefficient), with Imax 0.992, IC50 0.158 ng/mL, and kout 0.00266 h−1 (baseline estimated as kin/kout).

## Exposure-response model

`Donidalorsen_Diep2026_PD_pkk` — turnover (indirect response type I), `response = E0*(1 - Emax*frac)`

| parameter | value (paper units) | SI |
|---|---|---|
| E0 | 0 | — |
| Emax | 0.992 | — |
| EC50 | 0.158 unknown | — |
| gamma | 1 | — |

Closed-form check points (response, SI): `at_0` = 0, `at_EC50` = 0, `at_inf` = 0

Deviations:

- `defaulted_parameters` — E0, gamma
- `pd_binding_exposure_unit_unresolved` — 'unknown' — the x axis is in the paper's unit, not SI

## Review

Verdict <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span> · route to `scholar`

| check | status | note |
|---|---|---|
| `T0_driver` | pass | driver is the drug, a synonym or one of its metabolites (or unnamed) |
| `T1_closed_form` | pass | engineer's check points reproduced from the bound parameters |
| `T1b_fmu` | skipped | template FMU / fmpy not available — advisory only |
| `T2_direction` | skipped | effect_direction 'inhibition' |
| `T3_plausibility` | pass | EC50, gamma, Imax and baseline in range |
| `T4_defaults` | fail | a core parameter took a library default: E0 |

Advisory:

- defaulted: E0 — a row the paper has and the record lacks
- exposure unit not resolved to SI — the x axis is in the paper's unit
