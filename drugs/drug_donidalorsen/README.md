## About

**Description.** Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disease characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling induced by excessive production of bradykinin.[A274308] Donidalorsen is a ligand-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide that reduces plasma prekallikrein production, thereby reducing bradykinin production and preventing the initiation of attacks.[L53788]

Donidalorsen was approved by the FDA in August 2025 for prophylactic use to prevent HAE attacks.[L53783,L53788] It is the first RNA-targeted therapy approved for HAE.[L53783]

**Indication.** Donidalorsen is indicated for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.[L53788]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
