**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The record was rejected because apparent parameters (CL/F 80.9 L/h, V/F 628 L) were combined with an absolute bioavailability of 0.048, double-correcting for F in the venlafaxine/O-desmethyl venlafaxine model.**

The paper reports CL/F, V/F, CLm/F (22.1 L/h) and Vm/F (238 L), all already adjusted for bioavailability, yet the record also carries an absolute bioavailability Fab of 0.048; applying both corrections violates apparent-parameter coherence. The record is also internally inconsistent: it is filed under desvenlafaxine while the measured compound is venlafaxine, and the metabolite clearance covariate is labelled 'θamisulpride on CLm/F' (0.593 L/h) despite no amesulpride in the model. A second reader disagreed on whether the bioavailability covariate (0.048) and the metabolite parameters CLm/F and Vm/F belong in the record, leaving those fields contested. Extracted — desvenlafaxine: CL/F 80.9 L/h, V/F 628 L, kabs 0.63 1/h, Fab 0.048, CLm/F 0.593 L/h; O-desmethyl venlafaxine: CLm/F 22.1 L/h, Vm/F 238 L.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on bioavailability: this record has 0.048, the second reading none; it also differs on 3 more fields. That field does not shape the model.

**Model structure:** parent + metabolite; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 7 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, CLm/F, V/F, Vm/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- compound tags: 4 row(s) → O-desmethyl venlafaxine (m_suffix 4)
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('θhealthy state on CL/F', value '0.617') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θamisulpride on CL/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Wang_2022_table_p5_1:row7:col1'])
- dropped duplicate Q27 ('CL/F', value '0.219') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q76 ('V/F', value '0.106') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q351 ('CLm/F', value '0.156') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q367 ('Vm/F', value '1.38') — already have one for this compound
- unit inherited for CLm/F (Q351): 'L/h' from a same-Q-code sibling (this row's label had no unit)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=venlafaxine
- template fit: PK_3M_3C — first-pass formation; parent 1 + hepatic, metabolites [1] (site presystemic: 'Results and conclusion: Concentrations of VEN and ODV were well described with a one-compartment model incorporating fir')
