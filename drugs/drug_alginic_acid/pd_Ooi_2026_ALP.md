<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Elafibranor and GFT1007 (sum of AUC) drive Alkaline phosphatase (in U/L): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of Alkaline phosphatase.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> In the joint ALP–TB PKPD model, the summed AUCτ,ss of elafibranor and GFT1007 (μmol·h/L) drives an inhibitory Emax effect on the zero-order production rate (kin) of alkaline phosphatase (ALP, U/L) in an indirect response model, with Hill coefficient fixed to 1; saturation was reached at AUCτ,ss sum above approximately 30 μmol·h/L, and most patients on 80 mg/day exceeded the AUCτ,ss,50 for ALP. The excerpts do not report numeric values for Emax, AUCτ,ss,50, kin, or the placebo effect.

## Models

<p>No downloads: this record is <b>rejected</b>, so it is not published as a model. Any archives generated for it before the verdict have been removed — a download outlives the page that explains it.</p>

<div class="pk-tab-mark" data-tab="Simulation"></div>

_No web simulator for this record: its structure has no shared WebAssembly template. The FMI archive under **Models** carries its own compiled FMU._
