## About

Ethacizine is an antiarrhythmic agent of the class Ic type, developed for the treatment of heart arrhythmia. It appears to remain experimental and is not an approved medicine in the European Union.

The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Beloborodov_1986 | relevant | 9 | 0 | The paper describes a population PK study of ethacizine in humans using a three-compartment model, but the specific numeric parameter values are not present in the provided evidence. |
| popPK | Kedrov_1988 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on pharmacodynamics (anti-arrhythmic effects) in rabbits and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters for ethacizine. |
| PD | Kedrov_1988 | not_relevant | 1 | 0 | The text provides only a qualitative summary of pharmacodynamic changes in an animal model without reporting any numeric concentration-effect data, dose-response curves, or PD parameters. |
| popPK | Lozinskiĭ_1990 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The study focuses on Bonnecor (disopyramide), not ethacizine, and only mentions ethacizine as a comparator without providing its specific quantitative PK parameters. |
| PD | Lozinskiĭ_1990 | not_relevant | 3 | 2 | The text mentions that ranges of effective concentrations are given but does not provide specific numeric PD parameters (like Emax, EC50) or a quantitative concentration-effect curve in the provided abstract. |
| popPK | Ratner_1992 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | no_text gate: only 116 chars of text extracted (&lt; 400) |
| PD | Ratner_1992 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper investigates the effect of ethacizine on calcium channel receptors and binding proteins, which is a pharmacological mechanism study, not a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) exposure-response or dose-response analysis with numeric PD parameters. |
