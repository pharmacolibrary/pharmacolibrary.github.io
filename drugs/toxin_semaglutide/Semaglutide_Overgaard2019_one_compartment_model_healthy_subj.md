### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge; the engineer did not exercise the covariate scenarios this record defines. Evidence: T2_covariates_not_exercised

**Steps:**
1. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.
2. Advisory only — the base model still replicates.
3. Check the record's covariate_definitions in _interpretv2.yaml.
4. Re-run the engineer for this drug if the covariate curves are wanted.

## Validation

**Reviewer per-scenario checks:**

| check | scenario | status | expected | obtained | ratio | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T2_covariates_not_exercised | (all) | fail | not captured | not captured | not captured | record has covariate_effects but the engineer simulated only the reference individual — covariate scenarios were not exercised |
| T3_apparent_invariant | not captured | pass | not captured | F=Fm=1, no molar correction | not captured | apparent params must not be double-corrected |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no emitted model to inspect (engineer build absent) |
| T6_deviations | not captured | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | no engineer deviations to adjudicate |
