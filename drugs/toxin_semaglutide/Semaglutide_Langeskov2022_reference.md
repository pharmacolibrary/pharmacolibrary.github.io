### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge

**Steps:**
1. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.

<sub>owner: **engineer** · guidance written by playbook</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `not_modelled` (reviewed 2026-09-11 08:47:07.440642+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-09-16 17:30:31.976618+00:00). Current validate status: `extracted`.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['Tlag']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)

**Interpretation flags:**
- built from REVIEW reference values (Langeskov_2022) — secondary source
- volume reported by review

## Web simulation

Runs **this record's model** in your browser as WebAssembly — nothing to install. The sliders start at the extracted values; the reference check compares the browser's peak against the FMPy result recorded when the record was built, and is withheld once a value has been edited.
