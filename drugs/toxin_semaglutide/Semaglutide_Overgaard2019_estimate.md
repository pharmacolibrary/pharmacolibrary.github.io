<table><thead><tr><th>column</th><th>what it holds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label (paper)</code></td><td>the row or statistic label exactly as printed in the paper (label_verbatim) — never normalised, so it can be found in the PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Q-code · name</code></td><td>the ontology parameter this label was matched to (Q22 = clearance, Q27 = CL/F, Q49 = ka, Q57 = half-life, …) and its canonical name. The Q-code, not the label, is what scoring and cross-paper merging use.</td></tr><tr><td><code>value</code></td><td>the estimate as reported in the paper.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit</code></td><td>the unit as printed (unit_verbatim).</td></tr><tr><td><code>value_si</code></td><td>the value converted to the canonical unit. Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>unit_canonical</code></td><td>the canonical unit for that Q-code, i.e. what value_si is expressed in.</td></tr><tr><td><code>RSE%</code></td><td>relative standard error of the estimate, when the paper reports one.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><td><code>covariates</code></td><td>covariate effects attached to this parameter (e.g. weight on CL).</td></tr><tr><td><code>IIV</code></td><td>inter-individual variability reported for this parameter.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded. This is NOT the same as zero or empty: the value is unknown, not measured to be nothing.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—</code></td><td>deliberately not shown: the column does not apply to this row.</td></tr><tr><td><code>—(suppressed)</code></td><td>the record is not in an accepted state, so its numbers are withheld.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- covariate level 'Body weight effect on CL and Q' → Q900:body_weight_effect_on_cl_and_q = 1.01 (linear_fractional on Q22)
- covariate level 'Body weight effect on Vc and Vp' → Q900:body_weight_effect_on_vc_and_vp = 0.923 (linear_fractional on Q22)
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('T2D effect on CL', value '1.12') — already have one for this compound
- covariate level 'Injection site effect on F' → Q900:injection_site_effect_on_f = 0.883 (linear_fractional on Q22)
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('Drug product strength effects on ka, 1 mg', value '0.0346') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('Drug product strength effects on ka, 3 mg', value '0.0526') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('Drug product strength effects on ka, 10 mg', value '0.139') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('T2D effect on ka', value '0.544') — already have one for this compound
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=semaglutide
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'estimate' subgroup of Overgaard_2019 (paper reports 4 populations: estimate, one-compartment model, one-compartment model from phase 3a trialsa, two-compartment final model)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

## Validation

**Scholar closed-form checks:**

| check | status | expected | obtained | ratio | tol | source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C0_has_structural_params | pass | not captured | 9 | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C0b_disposition_core | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C2_reference | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |
| C6_cl_magnitude | pass | &lt;= 90.0 L/h | 0.0348 | not captured | not captured | ['Tab4:row2:col1'] |
| C8_topology | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured | not captured |
