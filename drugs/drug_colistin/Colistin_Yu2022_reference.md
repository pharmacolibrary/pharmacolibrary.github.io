<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The colistin sulfate record was held back because the clearance reference check could not compute a comparison (ratio None), leaving the typical clearance value of 0.994 L/h unverified rather than shown to be wrong.**

The record reports colistin sulfate in critically ill patients with a typical clearance (TVCL) of 0.994 L/h, a volume of distribution of 20.7 L, and a creatinine-clearance covariate effect of 0.525. The reference check failed with ratio None, meaning no comparison could be computed; this is an inconclusive check, not a demonstrated fault in the values. The record is therefore flagged needs_review pending resolution of that inconclusive comparison. Extracted — colistin: V 20.7 L.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- column 'pk formula' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- column 'pk parameter' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Colistin sulfate' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Yu_2022_table_4:row0:col4', 'Yu_2022_table_4:row0:col5'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Polymyxin B sulfate (Yu et al., 2021)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Yu_2022_table_4:row1:col4', 'Yu_2022_table_4:row1:col5'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=colistin sulfate
- bound model equation to Q22 (CL): CL = 1.59+(CrCL/80)^0.408 L/h; V = 20.5 L
- Q22 (CL) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'TVCL (L/h)'; equation kept verbatim

**Extraction notes:**

- unparsed cell Yu_2022_table_4:row1:col2 = 'Sparse data from a TDM study (112 concentrations from 32 patients)'
- companion parameter table 4 transcribed (4 record(s))
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 3, 4
- captured model equation CL = 1.59+(CrCL/80)^0.408 L/h; V = 20.5 L
