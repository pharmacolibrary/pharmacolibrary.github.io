## About

Proscillaridin is a cardiac glycoside from squill that has been used as a cardiotonic agent, mainly for heart conditions such as heart failure. It is currently considered experimental and does not appear to be an approved medicine in major markets such as the European Union.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
