<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Agarwal_2024 | irrelevant | 2 | 1 | The study reports vector DNA biodistribution and shedding kinetics (clearance times, peak concentrations) rather than standard pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, ka) for the drug substance or its therapeutic protein product. |
| popPK | Cao_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study evaluates the pharmacokinetics of KJ103 (an IgG-degrading enzyme), not valoctocogene roxaparvovec. |
| popPK | Long_2019 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study reports pharmacodynamic parameters (FVIII-SQ Cmax and AUC) rather than pharmacokinetic disposition parameters (CL, V, ka) for the vector or transgene. |
| popPK | Long_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses exclusively on immunogenicity (antibody titers and cellular responses) and does not report pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance, volume, or half-life for valoctocogene roxaparvovec. |
| popPK | Long_2024 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on immunogenicity (antibodies and cellular immune responses) and safety outcomes, not pharmacokinetic disposition parameters like clearance or volume. |
| popPK | Mihaila_2023 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review focused on emicizumab and general gene therapy concepts, and does not report quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters for valoctocogene roxaparvovec. |

| popPK | Rana_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a narrative review of clinical trials focusing on efficacy and immunogenicity, and it does not report quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters or compartmental models for valoctocogene roxaparvovec. |
| popPK | Serrafi_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a narrative review of gene therapy in hemophilia that discusses clinical outcomes and mechanisms but does not report quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, Q, ka) for valoctocogene roxaparvovec. |
| popPK | Suoranta_2022 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review on AAV vector safety and engineering strategies, containing no pharmacokinetic data or quantitative disposition parameters for valoctocogene roxaparvovec. |
