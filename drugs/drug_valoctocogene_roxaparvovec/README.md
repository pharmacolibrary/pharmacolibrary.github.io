## About

**Description.** Valoctocogene roxaparvovec is an adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) based gene therapy vector that expresses the B-domain deleted SQ form of human coagulation factor VIII (hFVIII-SQ).[L43282] The expression of hFVIII-SQ is driven by a liver-specific promoter, which enables hepatocytes to produce factor VIII protein and increase the levels of active factor VIII in blood.[L43282,A252807] Valoctocogene roxaparvovec was approved by EMA in September 2022 and is indicated for the treatment of severe hemophilia A. It is not approved for use in the United States.[L43292] Hemophilia A treatments such as prophylactic regimens of exogenous factor VIII or [emicizumab] improve the clinical outcomes of patients but do not eliminate breakthrough bleeding.[A252797] As opposed to these therapies, valoctocogene roxaparvovec offers the advantage of continuous and measurable steady-state levels of coagulation factor VIII.[A252807]

**Indication.** Valoctocogene roxaparvovec is indicated for the treatment of severe hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) in adult patients without a history of factor VIII inhibitors and without detectable antibodies to adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5).[L43282]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
