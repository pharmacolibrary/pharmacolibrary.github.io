<table><thead><tr><th>badge</th><th>what it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">curated</span></td><td>hand-authored by a person — an exemplar, not an extraction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">extracted</span></td><td>the pipeline accepted the record: every closed-form check it could run passed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span></td><td>the reviewer ran the built model against the paper's own reported values and they agree — the best automatic verdict there is.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">accepted (caveats)</span></td><td>the model replicates the paper, but an advisory check failed — the record page names the caveat under the badge and the drug page shows it under the status.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span></td><td>extracted, then a check failed or a value looks implausible. The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Dings_2024 | relevant | 9 | 0 | The paper describes a population PK/PD model for theodrenaline (as part of a combination) but the specific numeric parameter values (CL, V, etc.) are not present in the provided evidence. |
| popPK | Dings_2026 | irrelevant | 2 | 2 | The study explicitly states that no pharmacokinetic samples were obtained and the kinetic parameters (CL, V) are from a hypothetical K/PD model with V fixed to 1 L, not true disposition parameters for theodrenaline. |
| popPK | Heller_2015 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study reports pharmacodynamic endpoints (time to MAP increase) rather than pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, ka) for theodrenaline. |
| popPK | Kloth_2017 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro pharmacodynamic study measuring contractile force and tension, not a pharmacokinetic study reporting disposition parameters like clearance or volume for theodrenaline. |
| popPK | Simon_2019 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | Theodrenaline is mentioned only as a vasopressor used for hemodynamic support, not as the subject drug for pharmacokinetic analysis. |
| PD | Simon_2019 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a protocol for a PK study in obese patients and does not report any pharmacodynamic (PD) data, exposure-response relationships, or numeric PD parameters for theodrenaline or any other drug. |
