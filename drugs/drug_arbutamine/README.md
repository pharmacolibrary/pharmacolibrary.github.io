## About

**Description.** Arbutamine, administered through a closed-loop, computer-controlled drug-delivery system, is indicated to elicit acute cardiovascular responses, similar to those produced by exercise, in order to aid in diagnosing the presence or absence of coronary artery disease in patients who cannot exercise adequately .

**Indication.** Used to elicit acute cardiovascular responses (cardiac stumulant), similar to those produced by exercise, in order to aid in diagnosing the presence or absence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients who cannot exercise adequately.

The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

| PD | Abou-Mohamed_1996 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The provided text is only the title of the paper and does not contain the full text, data, or numeric PD parameters required to assess the exposure-response relationship. |
| popPK | Cramer_1995 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the safety and efficacy of arbutamine for myocardial stress testing (pharmacodynamics/diagnostic utility) and does not report quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance or volume. |
| PD | Cramer_1995 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The paper reports clinical efficacy (sensitivity) and time-to-maximum effects for two dosing regimens but does not provide concentration-effect data, dose-response curves, or numeric PD parameters like Emax or EC50. |
| popPK | Kisanuki_2001 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a pharmacodynamic assessment of myocardial viability using arbutamine as a diagnostic agent, reporting no pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| popPK | Nagarajan_1996 | irrelevant | 1 | 0 | The study reports pharmacodynamic effects (hemodynamics, ischemia) rather than quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, t1/2) for arbutamine. |
| popPK | Valcke_1997 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The paper focuses on pharmacodynamic modeling and control algorithms for heart rate response, not pharmacokinetic disposition parameters (CL, V, etc.) for arbutamine. |
