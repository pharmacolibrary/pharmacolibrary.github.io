<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

### Reviewer guidance

**The dihydrocodeine record is incomplete: the parameter V/F (203 L) was not captured, leaving only 6 of 7 expected parameters covered, so the model was held back for review.**

The record, built from the abstract of Webb_2001 alone, covers CL/F 43 L/h, kabs 11 1/h, tlag 0.3 h, kel 0.216 1/h and metabolite parameters, but V/F (203 L) was neither emitted nor defaulted, failing the parameter coverage check (6 of 7). Because only the abstract was read, reported summary statistics stand in for a fitted model. The builder also substituted a default intercompartmental hepatic distribution flow of 90 L/h for the missing source values and assumed F=1 and Fm=1 with no molar correction. Extracted — dihydrocodeine: CL/F 43 L/h, V/F 203 l, kabs 11 1/h, tlag 0.3 h, kel 0.216 1/h, t1/2z 13 min; dihydromorphine: fm 0.015, kel 0.339 1/h, V 200 L.

<dbs-pgx drug="dihydrocodeine" model-id="Dihydrocodeine_Webb2001_reference" status="needs_review" stale="false" population="healthy volunteers" measured-compound="dihydrocodeine" parameterization="apparent" topology="parent_metabolite"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** parent–metabolite model: parent with 1 compartment(s) plus a liver compartment (first pass); metabolite dihydromorphine: 1 compartment(s); formed in the liver; oral dose — template `PK_3M_3C`.  
**Parameters:** 9 extracted.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `needs_review`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['q12/q21 (hepatic flow, 90 L/h)']
- `apparent_assumption`: F=1, Fm=1, no molar correction (parameterization=apparent)

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'P' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Webb_2001:abstract'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Mean pain AUC changes' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Webb_2001:abstract'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Caucasians' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Webb_2001:abstract'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Asians' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Webb_2001:abstract'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'aged' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Webb_2001:abstract'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'DHC/DHM ratio' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Webb_2001:abstract'])
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'lhx1' (CL/F)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'hx1' (kabs)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'hx1' (kel)
- dropped duplicate Q45 ('fm(DHM) 1stpass', value 0.022) — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'DHM' (kel)
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'DHM' (V1)
- dropped PD-category row 'ke0' → Q326 (ke0, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Webb_2001:abstract', 'Webb_2001:abstract', 'Webb_2001:abstract'])
- implicit units: 'CL/F' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'CL/F is a clearance parameter. In population PK, clearance is conventionally expressed in L/h. The value 43 is consisten')
- implicit units: 'ka' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'ka is a first-order absorption rate constant. Rate constants are conventionally expressed in 1/h. The value 11 is consis')
- implicit units: 'kel' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'kel is a first-order elimination rate constant. Rate constants are conventionally expressed in 1/h. The value 0.216 is c')
- implicit units: 'k(DHM)' → 1/h (from the popPK convention: 'k(DHM) is described as an elimination rate constant. Rate constants are conventionally expressed in 1/h. The value 0.339')
- implicit units: 'V(DHM)' → L (from the popPK convention: 'V(DHM) is a volume of distribution parameter. Volumes are conventionally expressed in L. The value 200 is consistent wit')
- metabolite volume: 'V(DHM)' Q63→Q61 for dihydromorphine — it is 1-compartment, so its central volume is its only volume
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=dihydrocodeine
- template fit: PK_3M_3C — first-pass formation; parent 1 + hepatic, metabolites [1] (site presystemic: 'Intercept constant of DHM while fm(DHM) was proportional could be fixed AT 0 (model 9) or be calculated as part of conve')
- row roles: 3 per-group rows of none other but 0 reference group(s) — kept as printed
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 17/17 row label(s) assigned, 9 linked by role; re-tagged dihydrocodeine→parent ×5, dihydrocodeine→dihydromorphine ×4
- abstract-only: no full text was available, so these values were read from the abstract's prose — reported summary statistics, not a fitted model

**Extraction notes:**
- no GROBID TEI available — transcribed from cached Webb_2001_extracted.txt (19 record(s)); values are summary statistics, not a fitted model
