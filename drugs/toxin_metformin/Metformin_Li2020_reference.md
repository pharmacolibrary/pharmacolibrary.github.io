# metformin — `Metformin_Li2020_reference`

> ## <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">needs review</span>

### Reviewer guidance

> ⚙️ **Pipeline limitation — reviewer_tooling.** the check reported a failure without computing a comparison, so this is an inconclusive check rather than a demonstrated fault<br><sub>evidence: `C2_reference failed (ratio None)`</sub>

> This is not a curation fix: the record is waiting on the pipeline, not on a reviewer's judgement.

**What is wrong:** the reference covariate scenario does not reconstruct.

**Steps:**
1. Not a curation fix — reviewer_tooling limitation.
2. Check covariate_definitions and the reference category in _interpretv2.yaml.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θ1' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T4:row6:col1', 'T4:row6:col2', 'T4:row6:col3', 'T4:row6:col4'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θ2' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T4:row7:col1', 'T4:row7:col2', 'T4:row7:col3', 'T4:row7:col4'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'θ3' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T4:row8:col1', 'T4:row8:col2', 'T4:row8:col3', 'T4:row8:col4'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=metformin
- bound model equation to Q27 (CL/F): CL/F = θ1 * (WT/75)^θ2 * (eGFR/102.5)^θ3. EXP (0.1797)
- Q27 (CL/F) is equation-defined: value moved to equation-variable 'CL/F'; equation kept verbatim
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 4
- captured model equation CL/F = θ1 * (WT/75)^θ2 * (eGFR/102.5)^θ3. EXP (0.1797)
