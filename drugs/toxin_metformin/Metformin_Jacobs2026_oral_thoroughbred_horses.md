### Reviewer guidance

> ⚙️ **Pipeline limitation — scholar.** a reported unit is missing from the conversion table, so the parameter reached the engineer without an SI value<br><sub>evidence: `Cmax`, `AUC∞`</sub>

> This is not a curation fix: the record is waiting on the pipeline, not on a reviewer's judgement.

**What is wrong:** no model exists yet, so there is nothing to judge; the engineer did not exercise the covariate scenarios this record defines. Evidence: T2_covariates_not_exercised.

**Steps:**
1. Not a curation fix — scholar limitation.
2. No curator action. Run the engineer for this drug.
3. Advisory only — the base model still replicates.
4. Check the record's covariate_definitions in _interpretv2.yaml.
5. Re-run the engineer for this drug if the covariate curves are wanted.

## Validation

**Reviewer per-scenario checks:**

| check | scenario | status | expected | obtained | ratio | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T2_covariates_not_exercised | (all) | fail | not captured | not captured | not captured | record has covariate_effects but the engineer simulated only the reference individual — covariate scenarios were not exercised |
| T3_param_coverage | not captured | skipped | not captured | not captured | not captured | no emitted model to inspect (engineer build absent) |
| T6_deviations | not captured | pass | not captured | not captured | not captured | no engineer deviations to adjudicate |
