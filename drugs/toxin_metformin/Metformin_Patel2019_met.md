## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'CL/F (mg/kg)/(L/kg*hr)' → Q27 (unit '[length] ** 3 * [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'V1 (mg/kg)/(μg/mL)' → Q63 (unit '[mass] / [length] ** 3' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'V2 (mg/kg)/(μg/mL)' → Q64 (unit '[mass] / [length] ** 3' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=metformin
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- structure disagreement: deterministic 3C vs LLM 2C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'met' subgroup of Patel_2019 (paper reports 3 populations: ator + grt, met, met + grt)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Chae_2012's review values (primary lacked it)
- gap-filled Q83 (tlag) from Zhang_2024's review values (primary lacked it)
