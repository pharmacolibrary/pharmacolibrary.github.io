### Reviewer guidance

**What is wrong:** every check the reviewer could run passed

**Steps:**
1. Confirm the model card and promote to 'curated' if it should be an exemplar. Promotion is a human decision; the reviewer never makes it.

<sub>owner: **curator** · guidance written by playbook</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-09-11 08:46:59.346767+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-09-16 14:45:01.266400+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ALAG2 (h)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T3:row10:col2', 'T3:row10:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'ρCL/F~Vc/F' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['T3:row16:col2', 'T3:row16:col3'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=metformin
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Chae_2012's review values (primary lacked it)
- gap-filled Q83 (tlag) from Zhang_2024's review values (primary lacked it)
