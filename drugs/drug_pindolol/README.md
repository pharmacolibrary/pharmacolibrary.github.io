## About

**Description.** Pindolol is a first generation non-selective beta blocker used in the treatment of hypertension.[L32353] Early research into the use of pindolol found it had chronotropic effects, and so further investigation focused on the treatment of arrhythmia.[A231059] Research into pindolol's use in the treatment of hypertension began in the early 1970s.[A231064]

Pindolol was granted FDA approval on 3 September 1982.[L32348]

**Indication.** Pindolol is indicated in the management of hypertension.[L32353] In Canada, it is also indicated in the prophylaxis of angina.[L32388]

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
