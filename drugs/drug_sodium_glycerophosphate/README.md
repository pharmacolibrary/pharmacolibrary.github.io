## About

**Description.** Sodium glycerophosphate is one of several glycerophosphate salts. It is used clinically to treat or prevent low phosphate levels [FDA Label]. Glycerophosphate is hydrolyzed to inorganic phosphate and glycerol in the body [A32667]. The extent of this reaction is dependent on the activity of serum alkaline phosphatases.

**Indication.** Sodium glycerophosphate is indicated for use as a source of phosphate in total parenteral nutrition [FDA Label]. It is used in combination with amino acids, dextrose, lipid emulsions, and other electrolytes.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
