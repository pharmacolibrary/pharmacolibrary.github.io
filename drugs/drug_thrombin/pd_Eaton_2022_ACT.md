<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Dabigatran drives activated clotting time (in s): delayed effect through an effect compartment.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Dabigatran plasma concentrations prolong the activated clotting time (ACT, s) in rabbits; the paper describes dabigatran as directly inhibiting thrombin-mediated coagulation with rapid onset, best captured by an effect-compartment sigmoid Emax model (more physiologically appropriate than a turnover model). Key estimates: E0 = 100 s, Emax = 899 s, Ce50 = 20.1 mg/L (BSV 0.7%), and effect-compartment equilibration half-life T1/2keo = 1.4 min (BSV 16.2%).

Empty when no conversion was possible — usually an unparseable or missing unit.</td></tr><tr><td><code>link</code></td><td>how the label was matched to the Q-code, with confidence. exact / boundary / fuzzy / tv_prefix / caption_compartment / special_case are deterministic string matches; llm, llm_confirmed, llm_corrected involved the model; review and review_gapfill come from the secondary review tier, the latter filling a parameter the primary extraction missed; boundary_relink is a corrected match.</td></tr><tr><td><code>source</code></td><td>where in the paper the number came from: colN = that column of the located table, other_prose = running text, review = the secondary tier, pgx = a pharmacogenomic record.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:left;padding-top:10px">placeholders</th></tr><tr><td><code>not captured</code></td><td>the field is absent from the KB artifact — nothing was recorded.

<p>No downloads: this record is <b>rejected</b>, so it is not published as a model. Any archives generated for it before the verdict have been removed — a download outlives the page that explains it.</p>

_No web simulator for this record: its structure has no shared WebAssembly template. The FMI archive under **Models** carries its own compiled FMU._
