<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> ℹ️ No reviewer record yet — status shown is the scholar **validate** result; simulation-based reviewer checks have not been run.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `fosravuconazole, itraconazole`, measured `itraconazole, hydroxyitraconazole`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Rate of absorption (ka)' → Q49 (unit '[time]' vs ontology '1 / [time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Michaelis-Menten constant (Km)' → Q1 (unit '[length]' vs ontology '[mass] / [length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Fold increase in F during the loading dose phasec' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['jiaf279-T2:row8:col2', 'jiaf279-T2:row8:col3'])
- routed 'Between-subject variability in Vc' → Q312 (IIV) to iiv — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- routed 'Between-subject variability in Km' → Q312 (IIV) to iiv — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- routed 'Between-occasion variability in F' → Q313 (IOV) to iov — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- dropped PD-category row 'Maximum effect of autoinhibition (Emax)' → Q320 (Emax, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['jiaf279-T2:row19:col2'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Itraconazole plus hydroxyitraconazole concentration at 50% of autoinhibition effect (EC50)' → Q321 (EC50, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['jiaf279-T2:row20:col2', 'jiaf279-T2:row20:col3'])
- routed 'Between-subject variability in CLp' → Q312 (IIV) to iiv — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- routed 'Between-subject variability in Vp' → Q312 (IIV) to iiv — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- routed 'Between-subject variability in CLm' → Q312 (IIV) to iiv — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- covariate effect for Q61 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- covariate effect for Q63 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- implicit units: 'Maximum velocity (Vmax)b' — the LLM proposed 'mg/h', whose dimension does not fit Q66; left unset
- implicit units: 'Volume of distribution central compartment (Vc)b' → L (from the paper text: "The text states: 'The Vd for the central and the peripheral compartments were 20.8 L (95% CI, 12.2–33.3) and 262 L (95% ")
- implicit units: 'Intercompartmental clearance (Q)b' → L/h (from the popPK convention: 'The paper does not explicitly state the unit for Q in the text or table caption. However, Q is an intercompartmental cle')
- implicit units: 'Volume of distribution peripheral compartment (Vp)b' → L (from the paper text: "The text states: 'The Vd for the central and the peripheral compartments were 20.8 L (95% CI, 12.2–33.3) and 262 L (95% ")
- implicit units: 'Clearance of itraconazole (CLp)b' → L/h (from the paper text: "The text states: 'In the final population PK model for itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole, the CL values were estimate")
- implicit units: 'Clearance of metabolite hydroxyitraconazole (CLm)b' → L/h (from the paper text: "The text states: 'In the final population PK model for itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole, the CL values were estimate")
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q63 (Volume of distribution central compartment (Vc)b); Q30 (Intercompartmental clearance (Q)b); Q64 (Volume of distribution peripheral compartment (Vp)b); Q22 (Clearance of itraconazole (CLp)b); Q22 (Clearance of metabolite hydroxyitraconazole (CLm)b)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=itraconazole, hydroxyitraconazole
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 22/22 row label(s) assigned, 18 linked by role; re-tagged itraconazole, hydroxyitraconazole→ravuconazole ×25, itraconazole, hydroxyitraconazole→itraconazole ×13, itraconazole, hydroxyitraconazole→hydroxyitraconazole ×8
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
