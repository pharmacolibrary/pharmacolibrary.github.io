<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

<dbs-pgx drug="filgrastim" model-id="Filgrastim_Jiang2025_reference" status="rejected" stale="false" population="healthy adults" measured-compound="filgrastim" parameterization="mechanistic" topology="2C"></dbs-pgx>

**Model structure:** 2-compartment; no model was built for this record.  
**Parameters:** 5 extracted.

**Parameterization:** mechanistic.

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'ωV (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('IIV b')
- table section iiv: 'ωCL (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('IIV b')
- table section iiv: 'ωktr_pk (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('IIV b')
- table section iiv: 'ωN0 (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('IIV b')
- table section iiv: 'ωktr_pd (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('IIV b')
- table section iiv: 'ωEmax (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('IIV b')
- table section iiv: 'ωgamma (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('IIV b')
- table section iov: 'γktr_pk (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('IOV')
- table section iov: 'γN0 (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('IOV')
- table section residual_error: 'Magnitude of additive error for G‐CSF' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability')
- table section residual_error: 'Magnitude of proportional error for G‐CSF' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability')
- table section residual_error: 'Magnitude of proportional error for CD34+' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability')
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'N0' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['cts70121-tbl-0002:row6:col1', 'cts70121-tbl-0002:row6:col2'])
- relinked 'ktr_pd (h−1)' Q338 → Q306 — same-named PK parameter preferred over the PD code in a popPK record
- dropped duplicate Q306 ('ktr_pd (h−1)', value '0.059') — already have one for this compound
- dropped PD-category row 'Emax' → Q320 (Emax, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['cts70121-tbl-0002:row8:col1', 'cts70121-tbl-0002:row8:col2'])
- dropped PD-category row 'EC50 (ng/mL)' → Q321 (EC50, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['cts70121-tbl-0002:row9:col1', 'cts70121-tbl-0002:row9:col2'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Gamma' → Q325 (Hill, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['cts70121-tbl-0002:row10:col1', 'cts70121-tbl-0002:row10:col2'])
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('βCL_logWT', value '0.75') — already have one for this compound
- implicit units: 'βV_logWT' → L (from the popPK convention: "The parameter is a 'Volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment' (V2). In population pharmacokinetic modeling, ")
- apparent-by-design (ADVISORY, codes unchanged): extravascular dosing with no identifiable F, so these reported disposition parameters are likely apparent unless the model puts first-pass in its structure — Q61 (V (L)); Q22 (CL (L/h)); Q64 (βV_logWT)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=filgrastim
- molar mass: none found for 'filgrastim' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
