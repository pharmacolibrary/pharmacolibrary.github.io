> **Species: rat.** This record comes from an animal study (rat), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from the LLM relevance screen, p(non-human) 1.00).

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Nifedipine and captopril (parent plasma concentrations; no metabolite driver) (measured concentrations) drive blood pressure (in mmHg): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of blood pressure.

**Model:** A model was generated (see the **Models** tab); it has no in-browser simulator.

> In spontaneously hypertensive rats, BP (mmHg) is driven by plasma nifedipine and captopril concentrations (ng/mL): nifedipine lowers BP via an effect-compartment Emax effect (Emax,1 = 67.1 mmHg, EC50,1 = 86.3 ng/mL) counteracted by a homeostatic feedback modelled as a precursor-dependent indirect response in which an endogenous hypertensive substance is produced and degraded at rate kEHS,out = 0.0119 with linear feedback slope α = 1.17 (baseline E0 = 96.8 mmHg), whereas captopril's milder, concentration-following hypotensive effect is described by a sigmoid Emax model with an effect compartment (Emax = 41.8 mmHg, EC50,2 = 1450 ng/mL, γ = 0.662, E0 = 105 mmHg), with the combined effect given

| Emax | 0.0117 | — |
| EC50 | 86.3 ng/mL | 8.63e-05 kg/m3 |
| gamma | 0.662 | — |

Closed-form check points (response, SI): `at_0` = 96.8, `at_EC50` = 96.23, `at_inf` = 95.67
