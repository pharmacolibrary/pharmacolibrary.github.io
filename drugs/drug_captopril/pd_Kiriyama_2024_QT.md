> **Species: rat.** This record comes from an animal study (rat), not from people. The values, the model and its simulation are shown as the paper reports them — they describe that system, not human pharmacology (read from the LLM relevance screen, p(non-human) 1.00).

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Captopril (concentrations from this paper's PK model) drives QT interval (in msec): direct sigmoid Emax (Hill) effect.

**Model:** A model was generated (see the **Models** tab); it has no in-browser simulator.

> Captopril plasma concentration (ng/mL) acts on the QT interval (ms) in spontaneously hypertensive rats via a sigmoid Emax model with an effect compartment (C3, dC3/dt = ke0×C1 − ke0×C3), described in the paper as E = E0 + Emax·C3^γ/(EC50^γ + C3^γ) rather than the indirect-response form in the record. Key parameters for QT were E0 = 81.2 ms, Emax = 41.9, EC50,2 = 0.857 ng/mL (EC50,1 = 76.3 ng/mL), γ = 0.1347, and kEHS,out = 75.8, with sensitivity analysis showing low sensitivity of both ke0 and EC50 for the captopril QT profile.

## Exposure-response model

`Captopril_Kiriyama2024_PD_qt` — sigmoid_emax, `response = E0 + Emax*frac`

|---|---|---|
| E0 | 81.2 msec | 0.0812 s |

Verdict <span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">reviewed — candidate</span>

| `T2_direction` | pass | the response rises, as direct effect predicts |
| `T3_plausibility` | pass | EC50, gamma, Imax and baseline in range |
