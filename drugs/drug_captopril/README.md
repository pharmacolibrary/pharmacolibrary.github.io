## About

Captopril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure and congestive heart failure, and has also been used for conditions such as Raynaud disease and rheumatoid arthritis. It is an approved medicine and remains in use, generally as an oral antihypertensive, though it carries a boxed warning.

## Molecules and molar masses

> The molar mass each model uses to convert mass to molar concentration and to form a metabolite molecule for molecule. Looked up, never estimated: DrugBank for the drug, the paper's own value or the PubChem entry matched to the paper's name for a metabolite.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.
