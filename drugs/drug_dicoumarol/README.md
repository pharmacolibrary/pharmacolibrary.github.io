## About

Dicoumarol is an anticoagulant of the vitamin K antagonist class, historically used to treat and prevent blood clots such as pulmonary embolism. It is an approved drug, though it has largely been replaced by newer anticoagulants and is now rarely used in practice.

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.
