## About

**Description.** Insulin degludec is an ultra-long-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934]

Insulin is an essential treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin degludec, to lower glucose levels in the blood.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pan

**Indication.** Insulin degludec is indicated to improve glycemic control in patients 1 year of age and older with diabetes mellitus.[L42400]

A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.
