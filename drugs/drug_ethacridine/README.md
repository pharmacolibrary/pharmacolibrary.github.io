<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Akbar_2026 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the synthesis and in-vitro antibacterial efficacy of ethacridine-loaded nanocarriers, reporting no pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance, volume, or half-life. |
| popPK | Galli_2025 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a high-throughput screening study for anthelmintic activity where ethacridine is only one of many screened compounds, and it does not report any quantitative pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, etc.) for ethacridine. |
| PD | Galli_2025 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports EC50 values for flavonoids and other compounds, but does not contain any data or analysis for Ethacridine. |
| popPK | Kilgore_2024 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a mechanistic study on biomolecular condensates and small molecule partitioning, not a pharmacokinetic study, and ethacridine is only mentioned as a probe for subcellular localization without any PK parameters. |
| PD | Kilgore_2024 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the physicochemical partitioning of small molecules into biomolecular condensates and does not report pharmacodynamic (exposure-response) or dose-response relationships for Ethacridine. |
| popPK | Li_2020 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro antiviral study of ethacridine against SARS-CoV-2 and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, ka, etc.). |
| popPK | Li_2021 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is an in-vitro antiviral mechanism study reporting EC50/IC50 values, not a pharmacokinetic study with disposition parameters like clearance or volume. |
| popPK | Rising_1978 | relevant | 8 | 4 | The study reports quantitative PK parameters (half-life ~15h, absorption &lt;0.1%) for ethacridine in dogs, but lacks explicit clearance or volume values. |
| popPK | Wachsman_1996 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a review on oxidative damage and apoptosis that mentions ethacridine only as a mechanistic inhibitor of poly ADP-ribose glycohydrolase, with no pharmacokinetic data. |
