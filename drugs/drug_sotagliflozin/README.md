## About

Sotagliflozin is a blood glucose-lowering drug of the gliflozin class developed for type 1 diabetes. It has been investigated and, in some places, approved, but its marketing authorisation in the European Union was withdrawn, so it is not in routine use there.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
