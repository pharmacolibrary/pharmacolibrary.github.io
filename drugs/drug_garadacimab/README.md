- **ATC codes:** `B06AC07`

## About

**Description.** Garadacimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeted against activated factor XII.[L53283] It was developed by CSL Behring for use as a prophylactic agent in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare autosomal dominant disorder that results in acute episodes of angioedema.[A273993,A273998] As opposed to [lanadelumab], another prophylactic agent for HAE that targets kallikrein, garadacimab targets activated factor XII, the first factor in the contact system responsible for the signalling cascade that results in angioedema.[L53283,A273998]

Garadacimab received its first approval in Australia and the UK in January 2025, and has since been approved in a number of other jurisdictions, including the EU and Japan.[A273993] In June 2025, garadacimab was approved by the US FDA for the prophylaxis of HAE episodes in patients ≥12 years of age.[L53303,L53283] It is the first inhibitor of factor XIIa to receive market approval.[L53303]

**Indication.** Garadacimab is indicated for the prophylaxis hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.[L53283]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
