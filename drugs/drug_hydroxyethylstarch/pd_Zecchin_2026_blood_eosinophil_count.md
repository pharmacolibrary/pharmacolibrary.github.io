<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** Depemokimab drives name (in BEC): indirect response — drug inhibits the production of name.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Depemokimab concentrations inhibit blood eosinophil count (BEC) via an indirect response model in which the drug inhibits the production of eosinophils (IL-5–mediated), with parameters reported on the log scale: KRO −1.73 (SE 0.0529), KOUT −4.35 1/h (SE 0.0921), IC50 −2.34 μg/mL (SE 0.0789), Imax −1.77 (SE 0.0265), with baseline E0 −0.2601 (SD 0.3054); the paper does not state these values in natural units or a Hill coefficient value in the excerpts.
