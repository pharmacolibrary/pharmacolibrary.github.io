## About

**Description.** Glyburide is a second generation sulfonylurea used to treat patients with diabetes mellitus type II.[L8123] It is typically given to patients who cannot be managed with the standard first line therapy, [metformin].[L8123] Glyburide stimulates insulin secretion through the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels on beta cells, raising intracellular potassium and calcium ion concentrations.[A183617]

Glyburide was granted FDA approval on 1 May 1984.[L8117] A formulation with metformin was granted FDA approval on on 31 July 2000.[L8120]

**Indication.** Glyburide is indicated alone or as part of combination product with metformin, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L8120,L8123]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Nardotto_2017 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | Glibenclamide is only a co-administered drug in this study, which exclusively reports population pharmacokinetic parameters for carvedilol enantiomers and their metabolites. |
| popPK | Pearson_1985 | irrelevant | 3 | 5 | The paper is a narrative review summarizing literature ranges for half-life and volume of distribution rather than reporting original population PK parameters or primary study data tables. |
| popPK | Rambiritch_2016 | irrelevant | 3 | 7 | The study focuses on pharmacodynamic modeling and only cites a single clearance value from a prior publication rather than estimating original population PK parameters. |
| popPK | Vorasayan_2019 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | This is a clinical neuroimaging study evaluating glibenclamide's effect on brain edema and contains no pharmacokinetic parameters or population-PK modeling data. |
