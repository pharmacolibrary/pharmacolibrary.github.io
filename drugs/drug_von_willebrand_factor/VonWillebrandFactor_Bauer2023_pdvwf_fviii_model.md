**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**Accepted with a caveat: the covariate scenarios were not simulated.**

The base model was simulated, not the covariate effects the record defines.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which molecule was measured: this record has von Willebrand factor, the second reading VWF:RCo; it also differs on 7 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

<sub>reviewed by rule template (no LLM)</sub>

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `accepted_with_caveats` (reviewed 2026-09-28 14:42:07.737245+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-05 20:06:14.623010+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `recombinant von Willebrand factor`, measured `von Willebrand factor`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'EVWF, VWD type 3, IU/dL' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['t0004:row7:col3'])
- covariate level 'WT effect on CL and Q' → Q900:wt_effect_on_cl_and_q = 0.750 (linear_fractional on Q22)
- covariate level 'WT effect on Vc and Vp' → Q900:wt_effect_on_vc_and_vp = 1.00 (linear_fractional on Q22)
- dropped duplicate Q63 ('Hematocrit effect on Vc', value '-0.334') — already have one for this compound
- dropped PD-category row 'Baseline FVIII, IU/dLc,d' → Q324 (E0, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['t0004:row16:col3'])
- dropped PD-category row 'kout, h−1 c' → Q328 (kout, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['t0004:row17:col3'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Imax' → Q323 (Imax, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['t0004:row18:col3', 't0004:row18:col4'])
- dropped PD-category row 'IC50, IU/dL' → Q322 (IC50, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['t0004:row19:col3', 't0004:row19:col4'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Hematocrit effect on baseline FVIII' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['t0004:row20:col3'])
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=von Willebrand factor
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'pdvwf/fviii model' subgroup of Bauer_2023 (paper reports 2 populations: pdvwf/fviii model, rvwf model)
- molar mass: none found for 'von_willebrand_factor' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- molar mass: none found for 'von Willebrand factor' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Schöning_2026's review values (primary lacked it)
