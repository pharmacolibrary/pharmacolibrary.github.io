<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** BCT1028 (measured concentrations) drives CD61 abundance (in cell-surface abundance): direct Emax (saturable) effect.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> BCT1028 concentrations (μM) drive CD61 cell-surface abundance in K562 cells: the compound inhibits BLVRB (flavin reductase) enzymatic activity, causing dose-dependent ROS accumulation that signals megakaryocytic differentiation and CD61 acquisition, with intracellular accumulation co-segregating with CD61+ expression at 24–72 h. The paper reports an IC50 of 195 μM for BCT1028 in the DCPIP assay (530 μM in the FMN assay) and states that ROS accumulation was near-maximal at 20 μM, a concentration causing significant BLVRB inhibition; no Emax, kin, kout, ke0, or gamma values are given.
