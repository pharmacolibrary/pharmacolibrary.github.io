**Model:** A simulatable model was generated — see the **Models** and **Simulation** tabs.

> **Caveat** (`covariates_not_exercised`): the record defines covariate effects (weight on clearance, renal function …) but the engineer simulated only the reference individual, so those scenarios were never run. The base model still reproduces the paper; what is missing is the covariate curves.

### Reviewer guidance

**The pantoprazole paediatric model's simulated terminal half-life is 11.467454592412242 h versus the paper's 2.0 h (ratio 5.7337), and bioavailability (F) was left at library defaults instead of a paper estimate, so the record was held back.**

Simulated as the paper dosed it, the two-compartment pantoprazole model gives a terminal half-life of 11.467454592412242 h against the paper's 2.0 h, a 5.7337-fold discrepancy beyond tolerance. The record also uses a default placeholder for F (bioavailability) rather than a value estimated in Pettersen_2009, which affects the simulated profile without support from the paper. In addition, the covariate effects defined in the record (age 0.320, CYP2C19 inhibitor 0.342, hepatic dysfunction 0.501) were not exercised in simulation — only the reference individual was simulated. A second reader also disputed several extracted values, reading CL as 5.28 (vs 5.08), V2 as 2.73 (vs 2.69), age effect as 0.316 (vs 0.320), and reporting a SIRS covariate effect of 0.377 absent from this record. Extracted — pantoprazole: CL 5.08 l h -1, V1 2.2 l, Q 1.1 l h -1, V2 2.69 l, kabs 0.325 h -1, tlag 2.5 h.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has pantoprazole, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 7 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Deviations:**
- `defaulted_parameters`: ['F']

**Interpretation flags:**
- table section iiv: 'IIV CL (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (IIV) §')
- table section iiv: 'IIV Vc (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (IIV) §')
- table section iiv: 'IIV Q (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (IIV) §')
- table section iiv: 'IIV V2 (%)' routed out of structural estimates ('Interindividual variability (IIV) §')
- table section residual_error: 'Residual additive error (SD in mg l -1 ) ¶' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability')
- table section residual_error: 'Residual proportional error (%) §' routed out of structural estimates ('Residual variability')
- column 'parameter' classified 'other' by the LLM but kept: the deterministic diagnostic-column test disagrees (a stratum column is a value column, not a statistic)
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'SIRS covariate effect' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row16:col1', 'tab_1:row16:col2'])
- covariate level 'Age covariate effect' → Q900:age_covariate_effect = 0.320 (linear_fractional on Q22)
- covariate level 'CYP2C19 inhibitor covariate effect' → Q900:cyp2c19_inhibitor_covariate_effect = 0.342 (linear_fractional on Q22)
- covariate level 'Hepatic dysfunction covariate effect' → Q900:hepatic_dysfunction_covariate_effect = 0.501 (linear_fractional on Q22)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=pantoprazole
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from McCann_2023's review values (primary lacked it)
- gap-filled Q83 (tlag) from McCann_2023's review values (primary lacked it)

<p>Each archive holds the model source, a script that simulates it against the appropriate library, and a README describing both and how to run them.</p>
<p><b>FMI is two downloads.</b> The archive holds this record's parameters and its driver; the simulator itself is <code>PK_2C_enteral.fmu</code>, one compiled template shared by every model of this structure. Take the FMU once, keep it beside the script (or pass <code>--fmu PATH</code>). Running it reproduces the model-specific FMU exactly.</p>

<sub>Runs this record's model in the browser as WebAssembly. Sliders start at the extracted values; the reference check compares the browser's peak against the FMPy result recorded when the record was built, and is withheld once a value has been edited. Template `PK_2C_enteral` · parameters `Pantoprazole_Pettersen2009_reference_params.json` · controls `Pantoprazole_Pettersen2009_reference_sim_controls.json`. A slider marked *simulator value* is running on the template's own default because this record does not pin that parameter.</sub>
