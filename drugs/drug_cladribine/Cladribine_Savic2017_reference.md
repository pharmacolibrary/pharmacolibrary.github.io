<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The cladribine record mixes absolute parameters (CLR 3.52 L/h, CLNR 23.4 L/h, V1 44.0 L) with bioavailability-adjusted ones (V1/F 365 L, apparent hepatic CL 653 L/h) despite Fab 0.456, so apparent-parameter coherence is violated by a double correction and the model was rejected.**

The record carries both a bioavailability fraction (Fab 0.456) and F-adjusted apparent parameters — V1/F of 365 L and apparent hepatic clearance of 653 L/h — alongside unadjusted parameters for the same molecule, V1 of 44.0 L, renal clearance of 3.52 L/h and non-renal clearance of 23.4 L/h. Applying the bioavailability correction on top of parameters already expressed with it double-corrects the cladribine disposition, which is the coherence failure cited for rejection. No other failed checks or inconclusive comparisons are reported. Extracted — cladribine: CLR 3.52, CLNR 23.4, V1 44, Q3 14.3, Q 53.7, V3 347, kabs 1.08, Fab 0.456, … (+6).

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped duplicate Q77 ('Peripheral volume V4, L', value '89.5') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('Absorption rate constant (unknown/fed state), h−1', value '1.03') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q79 ('Fold increase in CLNR in the presence of IFNβ-1a', value '1.21') — already have one for this compound
- covariate effect for Q83 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=cladribine
- topology: transfer parameter unlinked (Q100) — add Kfm/formation-rate/rate-constant to the ontology; routing to review
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is PARENT_METABOLITE (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of TLAG: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 4
