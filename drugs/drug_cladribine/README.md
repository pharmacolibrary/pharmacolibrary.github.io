## About

**Description.** Cladribine is a purine analogue or a chlorinated derivative of adenine [A263733] that causes apoptosis of B and T lymphocytes.[A350] Cladribine was first approved in the United States in 1993 [A263713] initially as a treatment for a number of hematological malignancies; currently, it is approved for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia.[A263733] In 2017 in Europe and in 2019 in the United States, cladribine was also approved for the treatment multiple sclerosis.[A263718]

**Indication.** Intravenous cladribine is indicated for the treatment of active Hairy Cell Leukemia as defined by clinically significant anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or disease-related symptoms.[L50693]

Oral cladribine is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), including relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. Because of its safety profile, the use of cladribine is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of MS.[L50688, L50708]

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
