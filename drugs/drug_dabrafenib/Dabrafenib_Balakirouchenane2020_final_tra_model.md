A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** A model was built but held back: a core parameter had no value, so it is not published or simulated.

### Reviewer guidance

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has dabrafenib, the second reading dabrafenib, trametinib; it also differs on 1 more field. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

> ℹ️ No reviewer record yet — status shown is the scholar **validate** result; simulation-based reviewer checks have not been run.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `dabrafenib and trametinib`, measured `dabrafenib, hydroxy-dabrafenib, and trametinib`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- implicit units: 'ka (1/h)' → 1/h (from the paper text: 'The parameter listing states “ka (1/h) = 0.913.”')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=dabrafenib, hydroxy-dabrafenib, and trametinib
- template fit: PK_3M_9C — formed from central; parent 2, metabolites [0]
- population split: 'final tra model' subgroup of Balakirouchenane_2020 (paper reports 3 populations: dlt, final tra model, no dlt)
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 25/25 row label(s) assigned, 24 linked by role; re-tagged trametinib→dabrafenib ×1, trametinib→hydroxy-dabrafenib ×1, trametinib→dabrafenib, hydroxy-dabrafenib, and trametinib ×1
- molar mass: none of 1 PubChem candidate(s) is 'dabrafenib, hydroxy-dabrafenib, and trametinib' (LLM) — left in mass units
