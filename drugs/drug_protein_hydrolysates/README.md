| PD | Yang_2015 | not_relevant | 3 | 2 | The paper reports optimization of Maillard reaction conditions and qualitative/semi-quantitative anti-allergy effects (e.g., % release, EC50 for DPPH) but does not provide a pharmacodynamic exposure-response or dose-response model with numeric PD parameters (Emax, EC50 for the biological effect, slope) for the hydrolysate itself. |
| popPK | Zan_2023 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is an in-vitro mechanistic investigation of the bioactivity (ADH activation) of chickpea protein hydrolysates and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, V, ka, etc.). |
