<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Dose' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Krause_2023_table_2:row1:col3', 'Krause_2023_table_2:row1:col4'])
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('Morning administration on k_a', value '1.05') — already have one for this compound
- covariate level 'Lean body weight on V_c' → Q900:lean_body_weight_on_v_c = 0.37 (linear_fractional on the model)
- dropped duplicate Q64 ('Fat mass on V_p', value '0.72') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q30 ('Fat mass on Q', value '1.21') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'V_m (mg/h)' → Q66 (unit '[mass] / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- routed 'SD(F)' → Q312 (IIV) to iiv — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- unit_dimension_unknown: 't_lag' (tlag)
- dropped duplicate Q83 ('SD(t_lag)', value '0.26') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'k_a' (kabs)
- dropped duplicate Q49 ('SD(k_a)', value '0.59') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'V_c' (V1)
- dropped duplicate Q63 ('SD(V_c)', value '0.17') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'V_p' (V2)
- dropped duplicate Q64 ('SD(V_p)', value '0.23') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'Q' (Q)
- dropped duplicate Q30 ('SD(Q)', value '0.50') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'V_m' (Vmax)
- dropped duplicate Q66 ('SD(V_m)', value '0.09') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_unknown: 'K_m' (Km)
- dropped duplicate Q1 ('SD(K_m)', value '0.36') — already have one for this compound
- routed 'Multiplicative error' → Q316 (prop_error) to residual_error — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- implicit units: 'k_a (1/h)' → 1/h (from the paper text: 'Table 2 lists the parameter as "k a (1/h)" with estimate 1.05.')
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=daridorexant
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'all phase i data estimate' subgroup of Krause_2023 (paper reports 5 populations: all data, final model estimate, all data, final model rse(%), all phase i data estimate, food, phase i data (intense pk) estimate)

**Extraction notes:**
- no TEI final-model table id; trying text-pointer table recovery
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2, 3
