## About

**Description.** Bismuth subnitrate, also referred to as bismuth oxynitrate or bismuthyl nitrate, is a highly water-soluble crystalline compound that has been used as a treatment for duodenal ulcers and anti-diarrheic agent [A33012]. The use of bismuth substrate as an active ingredient in over-the-counter antacids is approved by the FDA.

**Indication.** Indicated for over-the-counter use as an antacid.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Screened and excluded

| domain | paper | verdict | relevance | extractability | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| popPK | Chen_1987 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the clinical efficacy of bismuth subnitrate in reducing cisplatin toxicity and does not report any pharmacokinetic parameters for bismuth subnitrate. |
| popPK | Hadžiabdić_2015 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper focuses on the physical stability and formulation of bismuth subnitrate suspensions, not pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| PD | Hadžiabdić_2015 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper discusses the physical stability and formulation of bismuth subnitrate suspensions (sedimentation, flocculation) and contains no pharmacodynamic, exposure-response, or dose-response data. |
| popPK | Heckers_1994 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study reports only peak concentrations and AUC values for bismuth subnitrate, lacking the specific quantitative disposition parameters (CL, V, ka, half-life) required for population pharmacokinetic modeling. |
| PD | Heckers_1994 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper reports PK parameters (serum concentrations, urinary excretion) and correlations between exposure metrics, but does not report any pharmacodynamic effect or dose-response relationship. |
| popPK | Jaggi_2005 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper studies the biodistribution of the radioactive isotope Bismuth-213 (213Bi) in the context of alpha-particle immunotherapy, not the pharmacokinetics of the drug bismuth subnitrate, which is only mentioned as a competitive antagonist. |
| popPK | Morikawa_1989 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The study focuses on cisplatin pharmacokinetics, and while bismuth subnitrate is co-administered, no quantitative PK parameters (CL, V, ka, etc.) for bismuth are reported in the evidence. |
| popPK | Morikawa_1990 | relevant | 8 | 0 | The study reports pharmacokinetics of bismuth subnitrate in humans, but the provided evidence contains only qualitative descriptions without specific numeric parameter values. |
| PGx | Nakajima_2012 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a case report of H. pylori eradication using bismuth subnitrate and does not report any pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters or pharmacogenomic effects for bismuth subnitrate. |
| popPK | Slikkerveer_1989 | irrelevant | 2 | 0 | The paper is a review discussing general bismuth pharmacokinetics and toxicity without reporting specific quantitative compartmental parameters (CL, V, Q, ka) for bismuth subnitrate. |
| popPK | Takahashi_1989 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study focuses on the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin, with bismuth subnitrate serving only as a co-administered agent to alleviate renal impairment, and no PK parameters for bismuth subnitrate are reported. |
