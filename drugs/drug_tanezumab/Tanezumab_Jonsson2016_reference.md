**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The tanezumab record was rejected because one structural parameter's reported unit could not be expressed in SI units, producing a dimension mismatch on a structural parameter.**

The two-compartment tanezumab model carries clearance 0.135 l day–1, central volume 2.71 l, intercompartmental clearance 0.371 l day–1, peripheral volume 1.98 l, plus target-mediated parameters Km 27.7 ng ml–1 and Vmax 8.03 μg day–1 and weight and gender covariate effects. One of the reported units could not be converted to a standard SI unit, so that parameter entered the model without a consistent dimension, and the dimension check on a structural parameter failed. The record was therefore rejected. Extracted — tanezumab: CL 0.135 l day –1, V1 2.71 l, Q 0.371 l day –1, V2 1.98 l, Km 27.7 ng ml –1, Vmax 8.03 μg day –1.

Independently confirmed by `gpt-oss:120b`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped value-less row: 'Parameter'
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Mixture probability with low RSV' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['bcp12850-tbl-0002:row5:col1'])
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'VM (μg day –1)' → Q66 (unit '[mass] / [time]' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'CL cr on CL' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['bcp12850-tbl-0002:row11:col1'])
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('Dose on CL', value '0.0669') — already have one for this compound
- covariate level 'Gender on CL' → Q900:gender_on_cl = 0.143 (linear_fractional on Q22)
- routed 'Cov CL‐V 1 ‡' → Q314 (omega_cov) to covariance — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Low RSV, %CV' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['bcp12850-tbl-0002:row20:col1'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'High RSV, %CV' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['bcp12850-tbl-0002:row21:col1'])
- covariate effect for Q3 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- covariate effect for Q314 has no base parameter row (kept as unattached equation-variable)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=tanezumab
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- molar mass: none found for 'tanezumab' — its concentrations stay mass-only
