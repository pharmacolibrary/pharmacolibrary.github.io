## About

**Description.** D-Alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (Tocofersolan, Vedrop), has been developed in Europe as an orally bioavailable source of vitamin E in children suffering from cholestasis [L2371]. Cholestasis is the reduction or stoppage of bile flow, either to impaired secretion by _hepatocytes_ (liver cells) or obstruction [L2374], [L2375].

Tocofersolan is a polyethylene glycol derivative of α-tocopherol and synthetic water-soluble version of [DB11251]. Tocofersolan is an oral treatment of vitamin E deficiency due to digestive malabsorption in pediatric patients with congenital chronic cholestasis or hereditary chronic cholestasis. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in June 2009 under the market name Vedrop. Moreover, the agent is capable of demonstrating antioxidant effects that make it a popular component to include in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals as well.

In addition to the above, tocofersolan has been studied as a promising application as an absorption enhancer in drug delivery [MSDS].

**Indication.** Tocofersolan is indicated in vitamin E deficiency caused by digestive malabsorption in pediatric patients with congenital chronic cholestasis or hereditary chronic cholestasis from birth (full term newborns) up to 18 years of age [L2371].

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
