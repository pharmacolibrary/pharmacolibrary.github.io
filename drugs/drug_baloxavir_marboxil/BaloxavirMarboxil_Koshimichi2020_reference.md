A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**Absorption rate constant for baloxavir acid is reported in liters/h, a dimensionally invalid unit for a first-order rate constant.**

The absorption rate constant is assigned a value of 0.905 with the unit 'liters/h', which is dimensionally incorrect for a first-order process. Since this unit is incompatible with standard pharmacokinetic dimensions, the parameter could not be evaluated for structural consistency. Consequently, the model was rejected due to a dimension mismatch on this structural parameter. Extracted — baloxavir_acid: CLm/F 10.4 liters/h, V1/F 528 liters, Q/F 10.3 liters/h, V2/F 130 liters, Q2/F 1.25 liters/h, V3/F 131 liters, kabs 0.905 liters/h, tlag 0.323 h.

> ⚠️ **STALE** — review status `rejected` (reviewed 2026-10-07 14:33:14.318108+00:00) predates the upstream re-run (2026-10-07 15:33:05.877436+00:00). Current validate status: `rejected`.

> **Dose compound ≠ measured compound:** dosed `baloxavir marboxil`, measured `baloxavir acid`.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Ka (liters/h)' → Q49 (unit '[length] ** 3 / [time]' vs ontology '1 / [time]') — route to review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'CL/F' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['T2:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'Q/F' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['T2:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'V1/F' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['T2:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'V3/F' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['T2:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'kabs' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['T2:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['T2:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- metabolite baloxavir acid: Q27→Q351 — only the metabolite is measured and fm is not identifiable, so its CL/V are apparent (fm-divided)
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=baloxavir acid
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- template fit: none — only the metabolite is modelled — no parent compartment
- structure disagreement: deterministic 1C vs LLM 3C — review compartment count
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- row roles (LLM): model_class=compartmental; 29/29 row label(s) assigned, 32 linked by role
- review gap-fill skipped: this record measures 'baloxavir acid', not baloxavir_marboxil — the review values are the parent's

**Extraction notes:**
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
