<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The vestronidase alfa parameters (CL 9.61, V1 9.64, Q 16.3, V2 4.23) were reported with the unit 'units' instead of L/h or L, so no SI values could be established and the record was rejected.**

All four structural parameters of the two-compartment model — clearance 9.61, central volume 9.64, intercompartmental clearance 16.3, and peripheral volume 4.23 — carry the verbatim unit 'units', which does not state the physical dimension (L/h for clearances, L for volumes). This unit could not be converted to SI, so the parameters reached the model without valid SI values, giving a dimension mismatch on structural parameters. The record was therefore rejected. Extracted — vestronidase alfa: CL 9.61 units, V1 9.64 units, Q 16.3 units, V2 4.23 units.

A second, independent reading of the paper (`gpt-oss:120b`) disagrees on which compound was dosed: this record has vestronidase alfa, the second reading unknown; it also differs on 5 more fields. That field shapes the model, so the record is marked disputed.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'CL (L/h)a' → Q22 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Vc (L)a' → Q63 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Q (L/h)a' → Q30 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'Vp (L)a' → Q64 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'BWT on CL and Qb' → Q22 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3 / [time]') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q22 ('BWT on CL and Qb', value '12.4') — already have one for this compound
- unit_dimension_mismatch: 'BWT on Vc and Vpb' → Q63 (unit '[luminosity] / [length] ** 2' vs ontology '[length] ** 3') — route to review
- dropped duplicate Q63 ('BWT on Vc and Vpb', value '17.7') — already have one for this compound
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'NIL' from footnote/prose loose number 20 (source ['Tab2:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- covariate weight for allometric_exponent from footnote/prose kept as documentation only (['Tab2:footnote', 'Tab2:footnote'])
- NIL: refused to back-fill base 'omega_cov' from footnote/prose loose number None (source ['Tab2:footnote']); the table cell was unparseable — needs review
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=vestronidase alfa
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- molar mass: none found for 'vestronidase_alfa' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- molar mass: none found for 'vestronidase alfa' — its concentrations stay mass-only
