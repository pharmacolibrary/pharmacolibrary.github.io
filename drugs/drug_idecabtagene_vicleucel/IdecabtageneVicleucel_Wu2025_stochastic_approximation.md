The numbers are shown as read, not endorsed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">built, not shipped</span></td><td>a model was built, but a core parameter fell back to a library default, so it is not shipped.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">rejected</span></td><td>not accepted — the record is not a compartmental model, or nothing usable was extracted.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--neutral">not modelled</span></td><td>pipeline state, not a judgement: no model has been built for this record yet (likewise `not simulated`).</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--stale">stale</span></td><td>the reviewer's verdict predates the latest re-run of the paper — treat the status as out of date, not as current.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--green">cross-checked ✓</span></td><td>every independent reader agreed on every compared field. With more than one reader the badge counts them, e.g. 'cross-checked ✓ 2/2'.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--orange">cross-check: partial</span></td><td>a reader differs on a non-structural field (a population label, a flag), or the readers do not all agree with each other.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--red">cross-check: disputed</span></td><td>at least one reader differs on a structural parameter — a clearance, a volume, ka, a lag. The record still holds the FIRST reading; the disagreement is a signal for a reviewer, never an automatic correction.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="pk-badge pk-badge--species">rat</span></td><td>the data come from an animal (or in-vitro) study, not from people. The record, its model and its simulation are kept — they describe that species.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped PD-category row 'E0pop' → Q324 (E0, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Tab1:row3:col2', 'Tab1:row3:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'δEpop (1/day)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab1:row9:col2', 'Tab1:row9:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'fADApop (unitless)' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab1:row11:col2', 'Tab1:row11:col3'])
- dropped PD-category row 'βE0,FORMU' → Q324 (E0, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['Tab1:row12:col2', 'Tab1:row12:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'βE0,logtCRCLBL' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab1:row13:col2', 'Tab1:row13:col3'])
- dropped duplicate Q56 ('βTmax,logtPRSB', value '0.0165') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q66 ('βVmax,FORMU', value '0.0628') — already have one for this compound
- dropped duplicate Q66 ('βVmax,logtDOSEA', value '0.193') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'βδE,BADA' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab1:row17:col2', 'Tab1:row17:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'βδM,logtPRSB' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab1:row18:col2', 'Tab1:row18:col3'])
- routed 'ωδE' → Q312 (IIV) to iiv — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- routed 'ωδM' → Q312 (IIV) to iiv — variability estimate, not a structural parameter
- dropped duplicate Q56 ('corrr,Tmax', value '0.0682') — already have one for this compound
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'a' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['Tab1:row32:col2', 'Tab1:row32:col3'])
- implicit units: 'Vmaxpop (× 103 copies/μg/day)' — the LLM proposed 'copies/μg/day', whose dimension does not fit Q66; left unset
- implicit units: 'Kmpop (× 103 copies/μg)' — the LLM proposed 'copies/μg', whose dimension does not fit Q372; left unset
- implicit units: 'rpop (1/day)' → 1/day (from the paper text: "Table 1 explicitly lists the unit for rpop as '(1/day)'.")
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=mechanistic, measured_compound=idecabtagene_vicleucel
- population split: 'stochastic approximation' subgroup of Wu_2025 (paper reports 2 populations: stochastic approximation, value)
- molar mass: none found for 'idecabtagene_vicleucel' — its concentrations stay mass-only
- skipped review gap-fill of CL: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary's parameterization (rate-constant / ka-only) does not use it
