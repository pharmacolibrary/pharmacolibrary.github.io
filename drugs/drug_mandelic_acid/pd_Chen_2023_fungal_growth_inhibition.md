<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

## What this record describes

**As extracted:** E13 (measured concentrations) drives name (in unknown) (inhibition; the model form was not identified).

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

> Mandelic acid derivative E13 (and analogues E1–E28) concentrations in mg/L inhibit mycelial growth of plant pathogenic fungi (e.g. G. saubinetii, V. dahliae, S. sclerotiorum) measured as percent growth inhibition in vitro; the paper reports EC50 values (e.g. E13: 20.4 mg/L against one fungus and 18.5 mg/L against another) but does not state a pharmacodynamic model or mechanism beyond speculation that E13 destroys the fungal cell membrane and wall.

- **paper:** `Chen_2023`
