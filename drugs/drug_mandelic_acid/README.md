## About

Mandelic acid is an antibacterial agent that has been used, notably as a urinary antiseptic and in irrigating solutions, to treat or prevent bacterial infections. It remains an approved medicine and is used mainly as an ingredient in antibacterial irrigating solutions and other antibacterial preparations, rather than as a widely prescribed systemic antibiotic.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
