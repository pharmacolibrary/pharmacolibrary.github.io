## About

Lercanidipine is a calcium channel blocker used as an antihypertensive drug to treat high blood pressure. It is an approved medicine, available alone and in fixed combinations with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, and is used fairly widely, especially in Europe.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers.
