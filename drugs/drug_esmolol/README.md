## About

**Description.** Esmolol, commonly marketed under the trade name Brevibloc, is a cardioselective beta-1 receptor blocker. It has a rapid onset but short duration of action without causing significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activities at recommended therapeutic doses. It works by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart, which leads to decreased force and rate of heart contractions. Esmolol prevents the action of two naturally occurring substances: epinephrine and norepinephrine.

The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all parenteral dosage form drug products containing esmolol hydrochloride that supply 250 milligrams/milliliter of concentrated esmolol per 10-milliliter ampule. Other esmolol formulations are still available for use.[L43942]

**Indication.** For the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Also used in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention.

| popPK | Zhou_2013 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The study is a cardiac mechanics investigation using esmolol as a pharmacological tool to alter inotropy, not a pharmacokinetic study, and reports no PK parameters for esmolol. |
| PD | Zhou_2013 | not_relevant | 2 | 1 | The study uses esmolol only to induce a low-inotropy state for comparison with dobutamine and ischemia; it reports correlations between rotational mechanics and hemodynamic indices (e.g., Emax) but does not provide a concentration-effect or dose-response model with numeric PD parameters for esmolol. |
| popPK | Zhu_2017_2 | irrelevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a systematic review of analgesic efficacy that explicitly states no studies were found for esmolol, and it contains no pharmacokinetic parameters. |
| PD | Zhu_2017_2 | not_relevant | 0 | 0 | The paper is a systematic review that explicitly states no studies were found for esmolol in pediatric surgical patients, and it does not report any pharmacodynamic parameters. |
