## About

Eprosartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker used to treat high blood pressure (arterial hypertension). It is an approved medicine, available alone and in combination with a diuretic, though it is not among the most widely used drugs of its class.

<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>
