<p><small>The first badge is the record's <b>status</b> — what the pipeline and the reviewer concluded. A second badge, when present, is the <b>cross-check</b>: whether a model of another family, re-reading the same paper, extracted the same numbers. They are independent — a rejected record can be cross-checked, and a confirmed reading can still fail a plausibility check.</small></p>

**Model:** No model was generated from this record.

### Reviewer guidance

**The gliclazide record was held back because the absorption rate constant ka was not reported in the source and a default value was invented, alongside defaulted lag time and an assumed F=1 apparent parameterization.**

The source reports AUCt 60 mg.h ml-1, CL/F 15 ml min-1 and V/F 19 l for gliclazide in Type 2 diabetic patients, but no ka or lag time, so the model builder substituted library defaults for both. The failed check flagged this invented absorption as not acceptable. Additionally, the unit mg.h ml-1 for AUCt could not be converted to SI, and bioavailability was assumed to be 1 with no molar correction, making the clearance and volume apparent (/F) values with first-order depot input for extravascular dosing. Extracted — gliclazide: AUCt 60 mg.h ml -1, CL/F 15 ml min -1, V/F 19 l.

**Parameterization:** CL/F, V/F — apparent, F unknown (apparent — bioavailability not identifiable).

## Parameters
> ⚠️ This record is not accepted (current status `rejected`) — the values below are the extraction as recorded, **not verified**; see the reviewer guidance above for what failed. Any model or simulator on the other tabs runs on these numbers.

## Departures & gaps

**Interpretation flags:**
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Diet alone' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row5:col2', 'tab_1:row15:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): '1 OHA class' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row6:col2', 'tab_1:row16:col2'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): '2 OHA classes' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row7:col2', 'tab_1:row17:col2'])
- dropped PD-category row 'E max (% of baseline FPG)' → Q320 (Emax, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['tab_1:row8:col2', 'tab_1:row8:col3'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Rate constant of equilibration k eq (day -1 )' → Q326 (ke0, category G11) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['tab_1:row10:col2', 'tab_1:row10:col3'])
- dropped PD-category row 'Constant rate of disease progression in' → Q340 (alpha_progression, category G13) — pharmacodynamic parameters belong to scholarpd, not the PK model (source ['tab_1:row12:col2', 'tab_1:row12:col3'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Responders' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row19:col5', 'tab_1:row19:col6'])
- dropped unlinked row (NIL): 'Nonresponders' — extend the ontology if this is a real PK parameter (source ['tab_1:row20:col5', 'tab_1:row20:col6'])
- salvaged Q27 ('apparent clearance'=15) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- salvaged Q76 ('apparent volume of distribution'=19) from results prose — parameter table was unreadable
- apparent-ness (ontology-grounded): parameterization=apparent, measured_compound=gliclazide
- held at status:extracted — NIL link or unit issue (mismatch/unknown/normalisation-failed) present
- status held at route_to_review — not promoted
- population split: 'intersubject variability' subgroup of Frey_2003 (paper reports 3 populations: intersubject variability, parameters, residual variability)
- skipped review gap-fill of V2: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- skipped review gap-fill of Q: primary is 1C (peripheral family needs ≥2C)
- gap-filled Q49 (kabs) from Mim_2023's review values (primary lacked it)

**Extraction notes:**
- unparsed cell tab_1:row4:col3 = '1 7'
- LLM selected parameter table(s) 2
